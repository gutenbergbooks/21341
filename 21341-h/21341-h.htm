<h2><a name="start" id="start"></a>Directions for Correcting a Theme</h2>


<p>When a theme is returned to you, number each correction, and draw a
heavy circle about the number. Then take another sheet of paper, and
using the numbers that correspond to those on your theme, state in each
case the error you made; then correct it, and give your reason for
making this correction: for instance, if the mistake is marked W,
i.e. a word misused, state whether the word to which the critic
objected is not in good usage, or is too often repeated, or does not
give the idea intended. Next, supply the proper word and show that it
fits the place. Answer any questions asked by the critic and follow out
any suggestion given. Put the sheet of corrections in proper form for a
<abbr title="manuscript">M.S.</abbr> Fasten the sheet to your original theme and hand both to the
teacher in charge of the laboratory. No credit will be given for any
written theme until the mistakes are corrected.</p>

<p>The following signs are used to indicate mistakes in a theme:</p>
<ul class="off big">
<li>C&mdash;Capital needed.</li>
<li>lc&mdash;No capital needed.</li>
<li>A&mdash;Mistake in use of the apostrophe.</li>
<li>S&mdash;Word misspelled.</li>
<li>P&mdash;Mistake in punctuation.</li>
<li>G&mdash;Mistake in grammar.</li>
<li>W&mdash;Wrong word used.</li>
<li>Cons&mdash;The construction of the sentence is poor.</li>
<li>D&mdash;The statement is ambiguous.</li>
<li>O&mdash;Order. This may refer to arrangement of words in a sentence, of
sentences in a paragraph, or of paragraphs in a theme.</li>
<li>U&mdash;The sentence or paragraph lacks unity.</li>
<li>X&mdash;Discover the mistake for yourself.</li>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> volume is the second in a series of four, each of which has been
planned to cover one stage in the composition work of the
secondary-school course. These books have been designed to supply
material adapted as exactly as possible to the capacity of the pupils.
Most of the exercises which they contain have been devised with the idea
of reproducing in an elementary form the methods of self-instruction
which have been employed by successful writers from Homer to Kipling.
Nearly all of them have been subjected to the test of actual classroom
use on a large scale. They may be used independently or as supplementary
to a more formal textbook. Each volume contains rather more work than an
ordinary class can do in one hundred recitations.</p>

<p>In each volume will be found exercises that involve each of the four
forms of discourse; but emphasis is placed in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr> on description, in
Book&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> on narration, in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr> on exposition, and in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="4">IV</abbr> on
argumentation. Similarly, while stress is laid in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr> on
letter-writing, in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> on journalism, in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr> on literary
effect, and in Book&nbsp;<abbr title="4">IV</abbr> on the civic aspects of composition, all of these
phases of the subject receive attention in each volume.</p>

<p>In every lesson of each book provision is made for oral work: first,
because it is an end valuable in itself; second, because it is of
incalculable use in preparing the ground for written work; third,
because it can be made to give the pupil a proper and powerful motive
for writing with care; and, fourth, because, when employed with
discretion, it lightens the teacher&#8217;s burden without impairing his
efficiency.</p>

<p>Composition is not writing. Writing is only one step in composition. The
gathering of material, the organization of material, criticism,
revision, publication, and the reaction that follows publication are
therefore in these volumes given due recognition.</p>

<p>The quotation at the head of each chapter and the poem at the end are
designed to furnish that stimulus to the will and the imagination
without which great practical achievement<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;iv">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a> is impossible. On the other
hand, the exercises are all designed on the theory that the sort of
idealism which has no practical results is a snare. Indeed, the books
might be characterized as an effort to find a useful compromise between
those warring types of educational theory which are usually
characterized by the words &ldquo;academic&rdquo; and &ldquo;vocational.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The specific subject of this volume is newspaper writing. The author has
himself had enough experience in practical newspaper work to appreciate
the difficulties and to respect the achievements of the journalist. He
knows that editors must print what people will buy. It seems probable,
therefore, that instruction in the elementary principles of newspaper
writing, in addition to producing good academic results, may lead pupils
to read the papers critically, to discriminate between the good and the
bad, and to demand a better quality of journalism than it is now
possible for editors to offer. If this happens, the papers will improve.
The aim of this book is therefore social as well as academic. It is also
vocational. Some of the boys and girls who study it will learn from its
pages the elements of the arts of proof-reading and reporting well
enough to begin, by virtue of the skill thus acquired, to earn their
bread and butter.</p>

<p>For the chapters on advertising I am indebted to Mr. Karl Murchey, of
the Cass Technical High School of Detroit, Michigan. Mr. John V.
Brennan, Miss Grace Albert, and Miss Eva Kinney, of the Detroit
Northwestern High School, have rendered me invaluable help by
suggestions, by proof-reading, and by trying out the exercises in their
classes. Mr. C.&nbsp;C. Certain, of Birmingham, Alabama, and Mr. E.&nbsp;H. Kemper
McComb, of the Technical High School, Indianapolis, by hints based on
their own wide experience and ripe scholarship, have enabled me to avoid
numerous pitfalls. My thanks are due also to Mr. Francis W. Daire, of
the <cite>Newark News</cite>, and Mr. C.&nbsp;B. Nicolson, of the <cite>Detroit Free Press</cite>,
who have given me the benefit of their experience as practical newspaper
men. Above all, I am indebted to my friend, Mr. Henry P. Hetherington,
of the <cite>Detroit Journal</cite>, whose untimely death in June, 1914, deprived
me of a never-failing source of wisdom and a critic to whose ripe
judgment I owe more than I know how to describe.</p>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> object of this book is to teach high-school boys and girls how to
write plain newspaper English. Next to letter-writing, this is at once
the simplest and the most practical form of composition. The pupil who
does pre&euml;minently well the work outlined in this volume may become a
proof-reader, a reporter, an editor, or even a journalist. In other
words, the student of this book is working on a practical
bread-and-butter proposition. He must remember, however, that the
lessons it contains are elementary. They are only a beginning. And even
this beginning can be made only by the most strenuous and persistent
exertions. English is not an easy subject. It is the hardest subject in
the curriculum. To succeed in English three things are required: (1)
Work; (2) <em>Work</em>; (3) WORK.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;The Newspaper</h3>

<p>The modern city newspaper is a complicated machine. At its head is
usually a general manager, who may be one of its owners. Directly
responsible to him are the business manager, the superintendent of the
mechanical department, and the managing editor.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;2">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>The business manager has under him three sub-departments: (1)
Advertising; (2) Circulation; (3) Auditing. To the first of these is
entrusted the duty of taking care of those small advertisements which,
owing to the fact that each occupies only a line or two, are called
&ldquo;liners&rdquo;; the management of a corps of solicitors; and the maintenance
of amicable relations with the business men of the community. The
circulation department includes not only the management of local and
foreign circulation, but also the collection of money from subscribers,
dealers, and newsboys. The auditor keeps the books, has charge of the
cash, and manages the payroll.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the mechanical department has three subordinates.
These are the foreman of the composing-room, the foreman of the
pressroom, and the foreman of the stereotyping-room. Each, of course,
always has several assistants and often many.</p>

<p>The managing editor has charge of the collection and distribution of
news. He has no routine duties, but is responsible for the conduct of
his subordinates, for the character of the paper, and for its success as
a business enterprise. The relation of the paper to the public is in his
keeping. Not infrequently he has serious differences of opinion with the
business manager, especially when he publishes news which does not
please important advertisers. Among his chief occupations are devising
methods of getting news and avoiding libel suits. The subordinates who
report directly to him are the writers of special columns, the
cartoonists, the editorial writers, the editor of the Sunday paper, and
the assistant managing editor, or news editor. It is with the latter and
his staff that we are at present chiefly concerned.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;3">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>The news editor, or night editor, as he is called on a morning paper,
has charge of all the routine that is involved in the production of the
paper. Its make-up is in his hands. An autocrat on space and place, he
is seldom praised, but must take the blame for everything that goes
wrong. Under him are: (1) A telegraph editor, whose business it is to
handle news from outside the State; (2) a State editor, who directs as
best he may a horde of local correspondents who represent the paper in
the rural and semi-rural districts; (3) one or more &ldquo;rewrite men&rdquo; or
copy-readers, whose business it is to write out the news sent in by
telephone, to correct the errors of illiterate reporters, and to rewrite
articles when necessary; and (4) the city editor.</p>

<p>This last functionary is frequently the most important man on the paper.
He is responsible for gathering nearly all of the original news that
goes into its columns. To be able to do this he must have a wide and
exact knowledge of the people and the history of the city. He works like
a slave; and the reporters, who are under his direct control, find in
him a stern but appreciative taskmaster.</p>

<p>These reporters, or news-gatherers, lead a strenuous but not unhappy
life. It is somewhat like that of the huntsman, their business being to
stalk news, which is perhaps the biggest and certainly the most elusive
game which the world produces. Their lives are sometimes, their liberty
oftener, and their jobs always, in danger. If one of them permits a
rival paper to get a &ldquo;scoop,&rdquo; he is apt to find himself in the situation
of the warrior described in Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnet:</p>

<blockquote class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;4">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The painful warrior, famous&euml;d for fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">After a thousand victories once foiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is from the book of honour raz&euml;d quite,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Some reporters hunt everywhere; others are assigned to special &ldquo;beats.&rdquo;
Of the latter the city hall is the most important, but the central
police station yields the largest number of good stories, because it is
there that tales of human folly, crime, and tragedy are most promptly
known. On most papers the law courts, politics, sport, drama, religion,
education, marine affairs, and society provide other &ldquo;beats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The organization thus briefly sketched is fairly typical, though by no
means universal. The outline on <a href="#Page_5">page&nbsp;5</a> may make it a little
clearer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em;">
<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;5">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>
<img src="images/diagram.png" alt="[Diagram showing the people who work for a newspaper.]" longdesc="#diagram_text" />
<p class="caption">[<a href="#diagram_text">Textual representation of diagram</a>.]</p>
</div>

<p>Good reporters are not numerous. The reason is that, to succeed in this
work, a man or a woman must be able to gather news and to write. There
are plenty of people who can do either, but few who can do both.</p>

<p>In order to get news one must be physically tireless, fond of adventure,
persistent, unabashed, polite, courageous, and resourceful in the
highest degree. To the successful reporter an impossibility is only an
opportunity in disguise. In his lexicon there is no such word as &ldquo;fail.&rdquo;
He must know how to make and keep friends. He must have that kind of
originality which is called &ldquo;initiative.&rdquo; Above all, he must be
scrupulously honest. He must be actuated by a fixed determination to get
the news, the whole news, and nothing but the news.</p>

<p>In order to write well one must be able to spell, punctuate, and
capitalize; know the laws of grammar and how to apply them; be familiar
with the principles of rhetoric; and have a wide acquaintance with
good<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;6">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a> books. These qualities are not usually found in company with
those which make a successful news-gatherer. A person who has both is
therefore worth his weight in gold to a newspaper. The fact that this
combination of qualities is so rare leads many papers to employ special
rewrite men whose business it is to put into good English the raw
material furnished by the news-gatherer.</p>

<p>One other newspaper functionary remains to be noticed, the writer of
editorials. News items are confined to facts. Editorials contain
expressions of opinion. Everybody reads news, because it speaks for
itself. Editorials are designed to mould public opinion. Unless they are
characterized by extreme good sense or brilliancy, nobody heeds them,
though, if he makes a mistake in one, the writer of editorials is apt to
conclude that everybody reads them. The writer of editorials must
therefore be a person of exceptional qualifications.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Class Organization</h3>

<p>For the present the teacher of the class studying this book may act as
city editor and the pupils as reporters. Later, perhaps, a more formal
organization may be effected, with pupils as managing editor, assistant
managing editor, city editor, etc.</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Newspaper Co&ouml;peration</h3>

<p>The editor of the local paper will probably be willing to print any
really good material that the class produces. If possible, an
arrangement for this purpose should be made with him. It is also
possible that he may be willing to supplement this chapter by talking to
the class.</p>

<br />
<small>NEWS ITEMS</small></h2>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Facts are stubborn things.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quotsig" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Sage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Find</span> and report some unusual and interesting thing that has been made or
done by boys or girls. Do not get your information from literature. Get
it from life. Above all, don&#8217;t make it up. It must be fact, not fiction.</p>

<p>When the city editor gives a reporter an assignment, he does not expect
to answer questions. The reporter&#8217;s business is to give the city editor
copy, not to rely on him for information. The reporter who does not
promptly learn this fact soon ceases to be a reporter.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Getting the Facts</h3>

<p>In all writing the gathering of material is more important than any
other one thing. In reportorial work it is almost all-important. Almost
anybody can tell a story if he has the facts. Energy, persistent
politeness, and a pair of stout legs are more essential in reporting
than is a large vocabulary. The pursuit of news is always a fascinating
and sometimes a dangerous game. If you do not believe this, read
<cite>Fighting in Flanders</cite>, by E. Alexander Powell; or <cite>The Events Man</cite>, by
Richard Barry. Above everything else, remember that the most
uncompromising adherence to facts is essential.</p>

<p>Do not make the mistake of supposing that newspaper<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;10">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a> men fail to
recognize the importance of telling the exact truth. They strive
constantly and strenuously to do so. In the office of the <cite>New York
World</cite> there used to be, and probably still is, a placard on which
Joseph Pulitzer had printed these three words: &ldquo;Accuracy, <strong>Accuracy</strong>,
ACCURACY.&rdquo; All reporters strive constantly to be accurate. If they do
not always succeed, it is due to the difficulty of the task. They have
to work fast lest the news grow cold. Usually they write in the midst of
an uproar. When you are disposed to find fault with them by reason of
their carelessness, remember that Sir Walter Raleigh, unable to
determine the facts concerning a quarrel that occurred under his own
window, concluded that his chance of telling the truth about events that
happened centuries previous was small.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Writing</h3>

<p>In preparing manuscript the typewriter in these days is almost
indispensable. The value to a reporter of a course in typewriting is
therefore obvious. It is also obvious that copy must be letter-perfect.
Before it can be printed, it must be entirely free from mistakes in
spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and the other essentials of good
usage.</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Model</h3>

<p>The following article is clipped from a New York daily. In what it says
and leaves unsaid it is an excellent model.</p>

<blockquote><h4>FARTHEST NORTH IS RIGHT HERE IN TOWN</h4>

<p>Hundreds of persons were attracted yesterday to Brook Avenue,
near One Hundred and Forty-ninth Street, to inspect the
handiwork in snow of three fourteen-year-old boys.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;11">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>They had built a thick-walled cottage, 25&nbsp;feet high and with
<abbr title="fifteen by sixteen">15&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;16</abbr>&nbsp;feet ground dimensions. Roof and walls, inside and out,
had been smoothed; and a coat of water had turned the snow house
into a shimmering glaze.</p>

<p>The interior was divided into four rooms, all bearing out the
truthfulness of the sign tacked up without, which read: &ldquo;House
to let, three rooms and bath.&rdquo; Even the bath, modeled in snow,
was there. Rugs, tables, chairs, and sofas made the Esquimau
edifice cozy within; and an oil stove kept eggs and coffee
sizzling merrily at dinner time.</p>

<p>The builders were three days at their task. They are Tom Brown,
of <abbr title="Number 516">No.&nbsp;516</abbr> East One Hundred and Forty-seventh Street; Arthur
Carraher, of <abbr title="Number 430">No.&nbsp;430</abbr> Brook Avenue; and Walter Waller, of <abbr title="Number 525">No.&nbsp;525</abbr>
East One Hundred and Forty-fifth Street.</p></blockquote>


<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Notes and Queries</h3>

<ol>
<li>State the reason for the use of each capital letter and each
mark of punctuation in the model.</li>

<li>Tell whether each sentence is simple, complex, or compound.</li>

<li>Explain the syntax of each adverb in the model.</li>

<li>Point out three words or phrases that have color, character,
or distinction.</li>

<li>What is the subject of each paragraph?</li>

<li>Are the &ldquo;Four W&#8217;s&rdquo; sufficiently indicated? Point them out.</li>

<li>Study the heading. The art of writing good headings is
almost as difficult as that of writing good poetry, which it
resembles in that, as the poet is limited to a certain
number of syllables, the writer of headlines is limited to a
fixed number of letters.</li>
</ol>


<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Suggested Time Schedule</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Monday</dt>

<dd>Discuss Sections <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, and <abbr title="3">III</abbr> of this chapter. Send the class to the
board and dictate the model as an exercise in spelling, punctuation, and
capitalization. Review last week&#8217;s work.</dd>

<dt>Tuesday</dt>

<dd>Recitation on Notes and Queries.</dd>

<dt><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;12">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>Wednesday</dt>

<dd>Oral Composition: i.e., each pupil will bring to class his news
article&mdash;not written but in his head&mdash;and be prepared to deliver it to
the class as if he were a reporter dictating to a stenographer or
telephoning his report to his paper.</dd>

<dt>Thursday</dt>

<dd>Profiting by Wednesday&#8217;s discussion, the pupils will write their
articles and hand them to the teacher, who will proof-read them and
return them on Monday.</dd>

<dt>Friday</dt>

<dd>Public Speaking&mdash;Organize the class as a club. Let the officers arrange
a program consisting of declamations, debates, essays, dialogues, etc.
This day may also be used for the reading of the best articles that
members of the class have written.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>&nbsp;Organization of Material</h3>

<p>After you get your story, you must decide on a plan for its discussion.
This will depend largely on its nature. Indeed, the plan and the style
of any piece of writing are to the material as are the clothes to the
body. They must fit the body. The body determines their shape.</p>

<p>The model in Section&nbsp;<abbr title="4">IV</abbr> is a bit of exposition composed partly of
description and partly of narration. Its framework is as follows:</p>

<ol class="off">
<li><abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;1.  The &ldquo;Four W&#8217;s&rdquo;:
<ul class="inline off">
<li>Who&nbsp;=&nbsp;hundreds of people;</li>
<li>What&nbsp;=&nbsp;handiwork in snow;</li>
<li>When&nbsp;=&nbsp;yesterday;</li>
<li>Where&nbsp;=&nbsp;Brook Avenue near One Hundred and Forty-ninth Street.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;2.  The Exterior of the House.</li>
<li><abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;3.  The Interior.</li>
<li><abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;4.  The Architects.</li>
</ol>


<h3><abbr title="8">VIII.</abbr>&nbsp;Some Possible Subjects</h3>


<ol>
<li>The Gas Engine that Jack built.</li>
<li>A Profitable Garden.</li>
<li><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;13">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>How a Boy earned his Education.</li>
<li>A Cabinet.</li>
<li>How to bind Books.</li>
<li>Stocking and keeping an Aquarium.</li>
<li>How to build a Flatboat.</li>
<li>How to make Dolls from Corn-Husks.</li>
<li>Metallic Band Work.</li>
<li>A Sled made of Ice.</li>
<li>Silk Culture.</li>
<li>Chickens.</li>
<li>A Good Notebook.</li>
<li>A Sketch-Book.</li>
<li>A Successful Composition.</li>
<li>Skees.</li>
<li>A Paper Boat.</li>
<li>Toys made in the Manual Training Rooms.</li>
<li>A Hat.</li>
<li>A Dress.</li>
<li>The best subject of all, however, is none of these, but one that the pupil finds himself.</li>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Write</span> a biographical note of about two hundred words concerning a
citizen who has just come into public notice.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Obtaining the Facts</h3>

<p>If the subject of the note is already distinguished, the facts can
usually be collected from books and periodicals. Poole&#8217;s <cite>Index of
Periodical Literature</cite> will point the way. Most newspapers keep an
indexed mass of biographical material, which, of course, is at a
reporter&#8217;s disposal. When these sources fail, the man himself must be
interviewed, which is a task that requires tact, politeness,
persistency, a good memory, and a clear idea of the character and
quantity of the information needed.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Models</h3>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="1">I</abbr></h4>

<p>James McHenry was born in Ireland, 1753; came to Philadelphia,
1771; studied medicine under Dr. Benjamin Rush; served in the
Revolutionary War as surgeon; became Washington&#8217;s secretary,
1778; sat in Congress, <abbr title="1783 to 1786">1783&ndash;86</abbr>; was a member of the
Constitutional Convention; was Secretary of War under Washington
and Adams, <abbr title="1796 to 1801">1796&ndash;1801</abbr>; and died in Baltimore, 1816. His most
conspicuous public service was rendered in inducing Maryland to
ratify the Constitution.<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;16">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a> Fort McHenry, the bombardment of which
in 1814 inspired Francis Scott Key to write the <cite>Star-Spangled
Banner</cite>, was named in McHenry&#8217;s honor. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="2">II</abbr></h4>

<p>Alexander Hamilton is one of those great Americans of whose
services to the nation no American can afford to be ignorant. As
a soldier in the Revolution, no man possessed more of
Washington&#8217;s confidence. To him as much as to any one man was
due the movement that resulted in the formation of the
Constitution; he took a leading part in the debates of the
Convention; and the ratification of the Constitution was brought
about largely by the <cite>Federalist</cite>, a paper in which he so ably
interpreted the provisions of that instrument that it has ever
since been regarded as one of the world&#8217;s political classics. As
Secretary of the Treasury under Washington he performed wonders;
Daniel Webster said of his work in this office: &ldquo;He rent the
rock of the national resources, and abundant streams of revenue
gushed forth. He touched the dead corpse of Public Credit, and
it sprung upon its feet.&rdquo; He was born in Nevis, one of the West
Indies, in 1757, and was mortally wounded by Aaron Burr in a
duel, 1804, at Weehawken, New Jersey. </p></blockquote>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Organization of Material</h3>

<p>Models <abbr title="1">I</abbr> and <abbr title="2">II</abbr> illustrate two types of biographical notes. That about
James McHenry consists of three sentences, which give: (1) A
chronological survey of his life; (2) a statement of his chief public
service; (3) the fact by which he is most likely to be remembered by the
casual reader. It is a good brief form to use in writing about most men
and women. Model&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> is better if the subject is remarkable for many
achievements. Its structure is as follows: (1) A keynote sentence; (2),
(3), (4) three illustrations of the fact stated in (1); (5) dates. The
same principles apply to notices of living people. In writing use one
model or the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;17">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a> other; do not deviate from them, unless you first find a
better model, and can persuade your teacher that it is better.</p>


<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li>Reduce some biography which you have read and enjoyed to a
biographical note of two hundred words.</li>

<li>Write a biographical note of two hundred words about a

<p>This is a report of an accident on a city street, witnessed by a
reporter, and telephoned to a colleague at the newspaper office.</p>

<blockquote><p>With a crash that could be heard for blocks, a high-powered
touring car, owned and driven by Mrs. William J. Sheldon, wife
of the millionaire gum manufacturer, who lives at East Boulevard
and Clifton Drive, collided late last night with a heavy milk
wagon at Payne Avenue and East <abbr title="Thirtieth Street">30th St</abbr>. Both Mrs. Sheldon and
John Goldrick, 656 East <abbr title="One hundred and fifth Street">105th St.</abbr>, driver of the milk wagon,
escaped injury, except for a few minor cuts and bruises.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon was driving east on Payne Avenue on the way to the
Pennsylvania Station at Euclid Avenue to meet her<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;20">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a> husband, who
was coming from New York. The street at Payne Avenue and East
<abbr title="Thirtieth Street">30th St.</abbr> had just been flushed; and, when Mrs. Sheldon
endeavored to turn out toward the car tracks to avoid hitting
Goldrick&#8217;s wagon, which was just turning into Payne Avenue, the
car skidded and side-swiped the wagon.</p>

<p>One wheel of the machine and the mud guard were torn loose,
while glass from the shattered wind-shield rained over Mrs.
Sheldon as she strove desperately to twist the wheel. Goldrick
was hurled from his seat, landing in the back of the wagon,
which was piled high with cases of milk bottles. The horses were
thrown from their feet by the shock.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon and Goldrick were extricated from the wreckage and
conveyed to the office of Dr. W.&nbsp;A. Masters, Payne Avenue and
East <abbr title="Thirty-second Street">32d St.</abbr>, where their injuries were dressed. Later they were
taken to their homes. </p></blockquote>

story.</li>

<li>Write an appropriate heading for the model.</li>
</ol>


<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Oral Composition</h3>

<p>Prepare a report of some accident which you have yourself seen or which
has been described to you by an eye-witness. Be sure to get into the
report in the proper order the &ldquo;Four W&#8217;s,&rdquo; the cause, and the result.
Note that a good story usually consists of three parts:</p>

<ol class="middle">
<li>The Previous Situation.</li>
<li>What Happened&nbsp;=&nbsp;The Climax.</li>
<li>The Result&nbsp;=&nbsp;The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&eacute;nouement</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are all in the model, but 2 is put first because it is most
important. Observe the order of the model. Each member of the class will
have a chance to make his report orally, and it will be subjected to the
analysis of the class and teacher, who will blame or praise it according
to its deserts. The reporter must defend himself, if attacked. Each
pupil will therefore in turn play the r&ocirc;le of a reporter, telephoning a
story to headquarters while the class and teacher enact the part of the
city editor.</p>


<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Written Composition</h3>

<p>After the process outlined in Section&nbsp;<abbr title="4">IV</abbr> of this chapter has shown the
reporter how to go about the job, the report is to be written,
proof-read by the teacher, corrected by the reporter, and rewritten
until it is letter-perfect.</p>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> worst thing about most news articles is that they tell of
destruction, failure, and tragedy instead of construction, success, and
happiness. If one were to judge from the papers, one would be forced to
conclude that the world is rapidly advancing from civilization to
barbarism. To test the truth of this assertion, you have only to examine
almost any current newspaper. A man may labor honorably and usefully for
a generation without being mentioned; but if he does or says a foolish
thing, the reporters flock to him as do cats to a plate of cream. The
reason is obvious. Tragedy is more exciting than any other form of
literature; it contains thrills; it sells papers. However, aside from
the fact that the publication of details concerning human folly and
misfortune is often cruel and unjust to the sufferers, its influence
upon the public is debasing in the same way, if not in the same degree,
as public executions were debasing.</p>

<p>Newspaper writing should, therefore, deal with progress rather than with
retrogression. Most newspaper men admit that this is true, but declare
that the public will not buy the kind of papers which all sensible
people approve. Just as soon as such papers can be made to pay, they
say, we shall have them. One<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;24">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a> of the objects of this course is to create
a taste for constructive rather than destructive newspapers.</p>

<p>As an exercise tending to produce this result, the student should each
day examine the local paper for the purpose of ascertaining how many
columns of destruction and how many of construction it contains. The
result should be reported to the class and thence to the papers as news.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of items which boys and girls can write and which
are constructive. These are:</p>


<ol class="middle">
<li>Items dealing with progress.</li>
<li>Humorous stories.</li>
<li>Items based on contrast.</li>
</ol>

<p>The work this week will be on the first of these.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Models</h3>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="1">I</abbr></h4>

<p><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis</span>, <abbr title="February the twenty-second">Feb.&nbsp;22.</abbr>&mdash;L.&nbsp;C. Phillips will plant 1,000&nbsp;acres of
his southeast Missouri land in sunflowers this year as a further
demonstration that this plant can be cultivated with profit on
land where other crops may not thrive so well. Phillips has been
experimenting for several years in the culture of sunflowers,
whose seed, when mixed with other seed, makes excellent chicken
and hog feed. Last year he planted nearly 100&nbsp;acres in
sunflowers. The cost of planting and harvesting is about $6 an
acre, he says, and the returns from $35 to $48. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="2">II</abbr></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Halifax, <abbr title="Nova Scotia">N.S.</abbr></span>, <abbr title="December the twenty-fifth">Dec.&nbsp;25.</abbr>&mdash;One of the most extraordinary
endowments bestowed by nature on any land is enjoyed by the
fortunate group of counties round the head of the Bay of Fundy,
Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Along the shores of this bay there are great stretches of meadow
land covered with rich grass and dotted with barns. These
meadows have been brought into existence by the power of the
tides in the Bay of Fundy, which have no<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;25">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a> parallel elsewhere on
the globe. There is sometimes a difference of sixty feet between
the levels of the water at low and at high tide. The tide sweeps
in with a rush, carrying with it a vast amount of solid material
scoured out of its channel.</p>

<p>The accumulated deposits of the ages have produced a soil
seventy or eighty feet deep. Owing to its peculiarities, this
meadow land retains its fertility in a marvelous way, producing
heavy crops of hay annually without diminution and without
renewal for an indefinite number of years.</p>

<p>When renewal is desired it is only necessary to open a dike,
which allows the tide to flood the land again and leave a fresh
deposit of soil. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="3">III</abbr></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <abbr title="December the twenty-fifth">Dec.&nbsp;25</abbr>.&mdash;Michigan holds sixth place among the
States in the value of its mineral production, with an output in
1912 valued at $180,062,486, according to the United States
Geological Survey, its prominence being due to its great wealth
in copper and iron. Ranking second only to Minnesota in the
production of iron ore, it is third in the production of copper,
being exceeded only by Arizona and Montana. It also stands first
in the production of salt, bromine, calcium chloride, graphite,
and sand lime brick.</p>

<p>In 1911 Michigan&#8217;s production of iron ore was 8,945,103 long
tons, valued at $23,810,710, and in 1912 it increased to
12,717,468 long tons, valued at $28,003,163.</p>

<p>The production of copper in Michigan, the value of which in the
last two years has exceeded that of the output of iron ore,
amounted in 1912 to 218,138,408&nbsp;pounds, valued at $135,992,837,
a decrease in quantity, but an increase in value of over
$8,000,000.</p>

<p>The mining of copper in Michigan is of prehistoric origin, the
metal having been used by the North American Indians before the
advent of the white man. The records since 1810, or for a little
more than 100&nbsp;years, show that the total production of copper in
Michigan from that date to the close of 1912 has amounted to
over <abbr title="Five point two billion pounds">5,200,000,000</abbr>&nbsp;pounds, which is about 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the
total output of the United States. </p></blockquote>

<p>All three of these items are evidently condensations of longer articles.
The writers have boiled down a vast amount of material into the form in
which it here appears. The student will find similar material in
abundance in <cite>The Literary Digest</cite>, in <cite>The Scientific American</cite>, in
<cite>The National Geographical Magazine</cite>, in many government reports, and in
almost any daily newspaper. In preparing for this exercise he should
observe the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find his material.</li>

<li>Boil it down, to the size desired, which is a most useful
exercise of the judgment.</li>

<li>Make a careful framework, in doing which the models will be

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Laughter</span>, when it hurts nobody, is wholesome. It is the handmaid of
happiness. It enriches life. Pleasant but not silly humor and wit are
therefore altogether desirable in a paper. Few days in anybody&#8217;s life
are devoid of incidents that tickle the fancy. Material for good
humorous stories is abundant everywhere. The faculty of recognizing it
when it is seen, and the ability to present it effectively, however,
need a little training. To make a beginning in these directions is the
object of the exercises that follow.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p>Find, but not in a book or a paper, a humorous story, and tell it, first
orally, then in writing.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Models</h3>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="1">I</abbr></h4>

<p>Called on to decide the ownership of a hen claimed by George
Bass and Joseph Nedrow, of Arnold City, Justice of the Peace
John Reisinger hit upon a &ldquo;Solomonesque&rdquo; solution. &ldquo;Take this
fowl to Arnold City,&rdquo; he directed his constable, &ldquo;and release it
near the poultry yards of these two men. In whose hen house it
goes to roost, to him it belongs.&rdquo; The constable, accompanied by
Bass and Nedrow, did as directed. When liberated, the bird
promptly flew into the chicken yard of Charles Black, where the
constable decided<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;30">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a> it would have to stay under the justice&#8217;s
ruling. The costs in the case amount to ten times the value of
the hen. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="2">II</abbr></h4>

<p>James M.&nbsp;I. Galloway, veterinary surgeon of Kirkintilloch,
Scotland, arrived yesterday from Glasgow with photographs of a
cow with a wooden leg on the starboard quarter, which the
veterinary says is almost as good to the cow as an ordinary leg
of beef and much more effective in knocking out folks who try to
milk her on the wrong side.</p>

<p>Other veterinaries laughed at Galloway, who is young and of an
experimental temperament, when he decided to save the life of
this cow after the leg had been cut off by a locomotive. He
insisted, however, on fitting the wooden leg, which he regards
as much more useful than wooden heads on Scotch veterinaries.</p>

<p>The only time the wooden leg gets the cow into trouble is when
she stands too long in a damp field and the leg sinks in a foot
or so. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="3">III</abbr></h4>

<p>The written orders of Mr. J.&nbsp;W. Brooks, a once celebrated
American railroad manager of Michigan, were, it is said, almost
beyond deciphering. On a certain occasion, when a double track
had been laid on one of his roads, it was reported at
headquarters that the barn of an old farmer stood partly upon
land which the company had bought, and dangerously near to
passing trains. Mr. Brooks, who was just getting ready for a
trip down the Mississippi, wrote to the farmer that he must move
his barn from the company&#8217;s land at once. If he delayed he would
be liable to a suit for damages. The old farmer duly received
the letter, and was able to make out the manager&#8217;s signature,
but not another word could he decipher. He took it to the
village postmaster, who, equally unable to translate the
hieroglyphics, was unwilling to acknowledge it. &ldquo;Didn&#8217;t you sell
a strip of land to the railroad?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I
guess this is a free pass over the road.&rdquo; And for over a year
the farmer used the manager&#8217;s letter as a pass, not one of the
conductors being able to dispute his translation of the
instrument. </p></blockquote>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Antithesis</span>, or contrast, is one of the two most effective devices at the
disposal of any artist, whether he works with words or colors. Its
skillful use often enables a newspaper writer to make a good item out of
trifling material. The object of this week&#8217;s work is to teach a little
of the art of using antithesis effectively in reportorial work.</p>

greens which had been mowed only a few<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;34">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a> days ago, and those who
were fond of flowers stopped now and then to pick a buttercup.</p>

<p>The greens keeper at Dunwoodie says that the greens have been
mowed four times since the latter part of September, when in
ordinary seasons the grass is mowed for the last time until
spring. The condition of the course is about the same as in May,
according to the greens keeper.</p>

<p>Up in Bronx Park the grass has not been mowed recently, but it
is unusually long for the time of year, and so it is in the
other city parks. The same condition prevails in the nearby
cemeteries. Out in New Jersey a fine crop of grass is in
evidence.</p>

<p>Farmers in the vicinity of New York are saving on their usual
bills for winter fodder, for with the spring weather and the
long grass the animals can pick up a living out of doors. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="3">III</abbr></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, <abbr title="December the thirty-first">Dec.&nbsp;31.</abbr>&mdash;An order for $2,000,000 worth of shrapnel,
to be used in the war in Europe, has been rejected by the
Commonwealth Steel Company of Granite City, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, it was learned
to-day, because Clarence H. Howard, president of the
organization, believes warfare should not be recognized.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard, who lives in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, is known all over the
country as the &ldquo;Golden rule steel man,&rdquo; because he tries to run
his plant in accordance with the Golden Rule by sharing profits
with the employes.</p>

<p>He is stopping at the Biltmore Hotel. Although he talked freely
of the trouble in Europe, he frowned at the report about the
$2,000,000 shrapnel order, and then said with blazing eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, our company would not accept an order for $15,000,000
worth of shrapnel! The war itself is a bitter shame. It is
something that does not belong in the general scheme of
enlightened humanity. If men would only think in unison, and
think purely and strongly for the abolition of war, it would
stop. There should be a general movement in the United States in
this direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a youngster I left my home in Centralia, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, to
win my own way in the world, and my mother gave<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;35">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a> me five
maxims&mdash;one for each finger&mdash;which I since have followed with
great profit. They are:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seek company among those whom you can trust and association
with whom will make you better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never gamble or go where gambling is done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never drink or go where drinking is done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As to smoking, it isn&#8217;t so bad as drinking or gambling, but
take my advice and let it alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When in doubt about where to go, stop and ask if it would be a
good place to take your mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Platitudes, eh! Some might call them that; but they have
brought me happiness, and they have brought happiness to others.
Not long ago I sat down and figured how much I had saved by not
drinking, gambling, or the like. I figured it out at $1,000 a
year, and it had been 30 years since my mother gave me the
advice.&rdquo; </p></blockquote>

<p><em>Journalism Instructors at Columbia Use Films to Develop
Students&#8217; Faculty of Observation.</em></p>

<p>Reporters&#8217; &ldquo;copy&rdquo; telling in graphic style of the Balkan War
poured into the &ldquo;city room&rdquo; of the newspaper plant at the
Columbia University School of Journalism yesterday. The reason
was that moving pictures had been adopted as a means of giving
to the students an opportunity to exercise their powers of
observation and description in such a fashion as would be
required of them in real newspaper work.</p>

<p>The idea of using a moving picture machine to train future
newspaper reporters in accuracy of observation was originated by
Professor Walter B. Pitkin, and was approved immediately by Dr.
Talcott Williams, director<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;39">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a> of the school. Dr. C.&nbsp;E. Lower,

perhaps never come back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he who commands will be
one of the first sons of France to die for his country in this
war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Volunteers were numerous. A young graduate of a polytechnic
school asked for the honor of leading those who would undertake
the mission. It was the son of Colonel Folque. The latter paled,

<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Model</h3>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, November&nbsp;<abbr title="the twenty-first">21</abbr>. The mystery of the disappearance of Mrs.
Pauline Edwards on November&nbsp;<abbr title="the eighteenth">18</abbr> was cleared up to-day. A party of
police visited her home at 96 East Twenty-third <abbr title="Street">St.</abbr> at 9&nbsp;<span class="allsc">A.M.</span>
for the purpose of making a final examination of the premises.
They found Mr. Allan Edwards, her husband, at home, and
compelled him to accompany them on their tour of inspection.
Careful scrutiny of all the rooms having failed to reveal any
evidence of foul play, they were about to leave the cellar,
which they had visited last, when Edwards, who was apparently
under the influence of liquor or strong excitement, called their
attention in abusive language to the construction of the walls,
at the same time rapping heavily with a cane upon the bricks of
the foundation of a chimney. His blows were answered by a sound
from within the chimney. It seemed at first like the sobbing of
a child and then swelled into an indescribable scream, howl, or
shriek. The wall was broken down, revealing<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;41">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a> the bloody corpse
of Mrs. Edwards. It stood erect. On its head sat a black cat.</p>

<p>On being arraigned before Police Justice O&#8217;Toole, Edwards
confessed his guilt and told the story of his life. He comes
from an excellent family, is a graduate of the University of
Utopia, and had a thriving business until, several years ago, he
became addicted to drink. During the summer of 1913, in a
drunken frenzy, he gouged out one eye of a cat named Pluto, who
had formerly been one of his pets. More recently he had
destroyed this animal by hanging it with a clothes line in his
yard. Remorse for this cruel deed caused him about two months
ago to domesticate another cat, which was exactly like the first
except that, whereas the first was entirely black, the second
had on its breast a white spot, shaped like a gallows.</p>

<p>This circumstance, the fact that the animal had only one eye,
and his own nervous condition soon made Edwards loathe and fear
the new cat. On the morning of November&nbsp;<abbr title="the seventeenth">17</abbr>, he and Mrs. Edwards
went to the cellar to inspect their supply of coal. The cat
followed them down the steep stairs and nearly overthrew
Edwards, who thereupon seized an axe and would have slain it,
had not Mrs. Edwards interposed. In his fury at being thwarted,
he buried the axe in her skull. As the cellar had been newly
plastered, he had no difficulty in removing some bricks from the
chimney, in concealing the remains in its interior, and in
repairing the wall in such a way that it did not differ in
appearance from the rest of the cellar.</p>

<p>Dr. Felix Leo, Professor of Zo&ouml;logy at Columbia, on having these
facts told him this morning, said he thought it unlikely that
Cat Number Two was the same individual as Cat Number One, though
the story of Androcles and the lion, if true, would indicate
that animals of the feline species sometimes remember and
reciprocate a kindness. &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said the doctor, solemnly
closing one eye, &ldquo;may we not suppose that a cat would have the
will and the intelligence to revenge an injury?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The theory of Edwards, who is now confined in a padded cell in
the Tombs, is different. He maintains that the two cats are one
and the same, and that the body of the beast is occupied by that
ubiquitous spirit who is variously known as Satan, Hornie,
Cloots, Mephistopheles, Pluto, and Old Nick. </p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;42">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Analysis of Model</h3>

<p>This story is simply a translation into newspaper English of Edgar Allen
Poe&#8217;s story entitled <cite>The Black Cat</cite>. Its three parts are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Situation.</em> A man is converted by drink into such a beast
that he first tortures and kills a pet and afterwards in his
frenzy murders his wife, concealing her body in a chimney.</li>

<li><em>Climax.</em> His crime is revealed by the wail of the cat,
which he had supposed dead but had walled up with the
corpse.</li>

<li><em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&eacute;nouement.</em> He is to be executed.

<p>Poe puts the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;nouement</i> first, the situation second, and the
climax last, which is a common and effective method in tales
of horror and mystery. The newspaper method is to put the
climax first, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;nouement</i> second, and the situation
last. This arrangement, which is as old as Homer&#8217;s
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, is thus alluded to by Byron:</p>

<blockquote class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Most epic poets plunge in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medias res</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then your hero tells, whene&#8217;er you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What went before&mdash;by way of episode.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></blockquote>

<p>For newspaper purposes this method is desirable because it makes
a good lead. That is, the first paragraph, and if possible the
first sentence, tells the biggest fact about the case. Readers&#8217;
attention being thus caught and economized, they get the habit
of buying papers.</p>

<p>This volume should go far to dissipate any idea that there is
not much of any consequence south of the Rio Grande besides the
Panama Canal. In the story of his journeyings over the length
and breadth of this enormous country&mdash;twice the size of
Mexico&mdash;Mr. Fraser paints us a picture of a progressive people,
and a country that is rapidly assuming a position as the
foremost producer of the world&#8217;s meat-supply. Stretching from
the Atlantic to the Andes Mountains and from north of the Tropic
of Capricorn to the Straits of Magellan, it supports 30,000,000
cattle, over 80,000,000 sheep, and 8,000,000 horses. The
railroads, in which the British have invested &pound;300,000,000, are
among the best equipped in the world, and carry annually
40,000,000 tons of freight, with approximate receipts of
&pound;25,000,000. The export trade is advancing by leaps and bounds,
and in 1912 the value of wool exports was &pound;50,000,000,
live-stock products &pound;35,000,000, and agricultural produce
&pound;53,000,000; while the extent of the frozen-meat business may be

<p>Cecil Rhodes must be looked upon as the Clive of South Africa.
He found that country a land of wilderness and savagery. He
transformed it into a fair and industrious province. He
possessed the unscrupulous and relentless spirit of such
conquerors as Julius C&aelig;sar, and he was at the same time a
financier of the widest resource. But some nefarious or alleged
nefarious transactions which stained his name as a business man
and a politician deprived him of royal recognition. He was not
only denied a title, but even failed to obtain a decoration, and
it was not until his death that a magnificent monument was
unveiled to his memory in the heart of Rhodesia, a province
which he had created and which was named after him.</p>

<p>Cecil John Rhodes (<abbr title="1853 to 1902">1853&ndash;1902</abbr>) was born, like so many eminent
Englishmen, in the house of a clergyman. Into the forty-nine
years of his life he compressed a very stirring chapter of
British victory. There was something of the buccaneer in his
character when he prompted the notorious Jameson Raid and
eventually brought the British Government into conflict with the
cunning and ambition of Kruger&mdash;Oom Paul, as he was styled. For
the bitter and bloody Boer War the blame has always been laid
upon the shoulders of Rhodes.</p>

<p>Rhodes was an Oxford man and an omnivorous reader. He began by
working in the diamond-mines at Kimberley as a common laborer;
he ended by becoming manager of the Chartered Company, and
amassing a vast fortune.&mdash;<cite>The Literary Digest</cite>, April, 1914.<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> </p></blockquote>

<p><cite>Sense and Sensibility.</cite> A Novel. By Jane Austen. London:
Egerton. 1811.</p>

<p>Though inferior to <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>, this work is about as
well worth reading as any novel which, previous to its
publication, had been written in the English language. Its
interest depends, not on its descriptive and narrative power,
but on character portrayal and humor.</p>

<p>Though both lovable girls, the two heroines, Elinor and
Marianne, are as imperfect and as different as sisters are apt
to be in real life. Vulgar match-making Mrs. Jennings, as Austin
Dobson calls her, like many a flesh-and-blood dowager, at first
repels us by her foolish prattle and finally wins our respect by
her kindness. Sir John Middleton, with his horror of being
alone; Lady Middleton, with her horror of impropriety; Miss
Steele, who can always be made happy by being teased about the
Doctor; Lucy Steele, pretty, clever, not over-fastidious in her
principles, and abominably weak in her grammar; Robert Ferrars,
whose airs are justly punished by his marriage to Lucy; Mrs.
Ferrars, who contrives to be uniformly unamiable; Mrs. John
Dashwood, fit daughter to such a mother; and Mr. John Dashwood,
fit husband to such a wife&mdash;together form a gallery of portraits
of which any author might be proud.</p>

<p>The book, too, is rich in humor. Among other delightful things
we read of a will which, like almost every other will, gave as
much disappointment as pleasure; of a child of three who
possesses the usual charms of that age, an imperfect
articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many
cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise; of apricot marmalade
applied successfully as a remedy for a bruised temple; of a
company who met to eat, drink, and laugh together, to play at
cards or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently
noisy; of a husband who is always making remarks which his wife
considers so droll but cannot remember; of Constantia wine,
which is equally good for colicky gout and broken hearts; of a
face of strong natural sterling insignificance; of a girl who
was pleased that a man had called and still more pleased that
she had missed him; of a woman of few words, for, unlike people
in general, she proportioned<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;48">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a> them to the number of her ideas;
of a newspaper item that interested nobody except those who knew
its contents before; and of a man who was perfectly the
gentleman in his behavior to guests and only occasionally rude
to his wife and mother-in-law.</p>

<p>It is true that the two heroes are not very heroic, Edward
Ferrars being only a curate and <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Brandon a poor old man of
36 with a flannel waistcoat; but the latter is pretty thoroughly
the gentleman and the former gives up a fortune of 30,000&nbsp;pounds
in order to marry a girl whom he does not love, thereby
furnishing, if not an example of good sense, at least an
agreeable contrast to Marianne&#8217;s lover, Willoughby, who marries
a girl whom he does not love in order to get the money which he
is too genteel to earn.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is a wonderful book to have been written by a
girl of twenty-one.<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> </p></blockquote>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Notes, Queries, and Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li>Among the important functions of a newspaper is the task of
announcing the appearance of new books, describing their
contents, and commenting on their merits. The style of such
notices should, above everything else, be clear. Most of
them are unfortunately disfigured by a jargon which repels
readers instead of inducing them to peruse the books
reviewed.</li>

<li>What information should the heading of a book notice
furnish?</li>

<li>Model&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr> is an excellent example of what a review in a single
paragraph should be. The first sentence bridges the
intellectual and geographical space between the United
States and Argentina, between the reader and the subject,
which is just what an introduction should do. The second
sentence describes the country in general terms, ending in a
clause that leads directly to the most striking single fact
about Argentina, its importance as an agricultural country.
The three sentences that follow give concrete facts in
support of this clause. The final sentence drives home the
point stated in the first.</li>

<li><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;49">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>Discuss the meaning and etymology of &ldquo;dissipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rio
Grande,&rdquo; &ldquo;annually,&rdquo; &ldquo;approximate,&rdquo; &ldquo;exports,&rdquo; &ldquo;enterprise.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Point out one restrictive and one non-restrictive clause.</li>

<li>Describe orally the location and character of the Rio
Grande, Mexico, the Panama Canal, the Atlantic, the Andes,
the Tropic of Capricorn, the British, and the Straits of
Magellan.</li>

<li>What figure of speech have we in the phrase, &ldquo;the Amazing
Argentine?&rdquo;</li>

<li>In Model&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> we have an illustration of a biographical review
in three paragraphs. It presents a vivid picture of Cecil
Rhodes in spite of the fact that it is not well organized.
Try the experiment of rewriting it according to this plan:
<abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr>&mdash;Introduction, or Bridge; <abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr>&mdash;Rhodes&#8217;s Services
to Mankind; <abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr>&mdash;Rhodes&#8217;s Faults; <abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;<abbr title="4">IV</abbr>&mdash;Rhodes&#8217;s
Private Life.</li>

<li>Find in the model an example of alliteration and an example
of antithesis.</li>

<li>Explain the allusions in &ldquo;Clive,&rdquo; &ldquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rdquo;
&ldquo;buccaneer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jameson Raid,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kruger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boer War,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Oxford.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Define &ldquo;financier,&rdquo; &ldquo;nefarious,&rdquo; &ldquo;politician,&rdquo; &ldquo;notorious,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ambition,&rdquo; and &ldquo;omnivorous.&rdquo; From what language do these
words come?</li>

<li>Analyze Model&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr> as <abbr title="1">I</abbr> and <abbr title="2">II</abbr> have already been analyzed
for you.</li>

<li>Find in <abbr title="3">III</abbr> an antithesis and an alliteration.</li>

<li>Which of the books do you wish most to read? Why?</li>

<li>Do these models observe the law of presenting concrete
rather than abstract statements?</li>

<li>Make a list of the books you have read, putting in one
column the books of travel, into another the biographies,
and into a third the novels.</li>

<li>Choose one of these as the subject of a review which you
are to write.</li>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it is fall, report a football game; if winter, a basket-ball game; if
spring or summer, a baseball game.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Material</h3>

<p>In order to be able to report a football game, one must understand the
rules of the game, be familiar with the <em>personnel</em> and history of the
opposing teams, and know the names of the officials. The task therefore
resolves itself into three parts:</p>

<ol class="middle">
<li>Learning the rules of the game.</li>
<li>Studying the teams and officials.</li>
<li>Attending the game and taking notes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those members of the class who are familiar with the rules may be
assigned the task of explaining them to the others; this is an excellent
exercise in oral composition. It should include: (1) A short history of
football; (2) A description of the field; (3) a description of the
equipment of a team; (4) an account of the organization of a team; (5) a
description of the way a game is played; (6) an explanation of the
rules. <cite>Spalding&#8217;s Football Guide</cite> contains all of the information
necessary, though it may be supplemented by encyclop&aelig;dias. It is
suggested that this exercise be organized for presentation as a
program.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;53">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>The study of the opposing teams may be managed in the same way. It
should include: (1) Their past history; (2) their <em>personnel</em>; (3) some
account of the officials and their qualifications.</p>

<p>Quick and accurate observation of what happens during a game is
essential. A good scheme for recording everything as it occurs is to
make a chart of the field in a notebook, and, as the game progresses, to
mark on it the progress of the ball, using a blue pencil when it is in
the possession of one side and a red pencil when the other has it. On
this chart brief notes of the methods by which the ball is advanced may
also be made.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Composition</h3>

<p>Football reports vary in length from a bare statement of the result of a
game to many columns, the determining factor in this particular being
the amount of public interest. The style is sometimes rendered
picturesque by a skillful use of metaphor, antithesis, and slang, but
more often is severely plain. The latter method is the only safe one for
beginners. Except in the hands of a genius, the former is sure to result
in silly vulgarity. The models which follow are of convenient length and
in style are admirable, being clear, correct, and free from vulgarity.</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Models</h3>

MICHIGAN, 15; <abbr title="Michigan Agricultural College">M.A.C.</abbr>, 3</h4>

<p>Michigan defeated the Michigan Agricultural College at Lansing
on Saturday, <abbr title="October the fourteenth">Oct.&nbsp;14</abbr>, in a game which marked the first defeat of
the Aggies on their home field. The Wolverines went into the
late minutes of the third quarter without<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;54">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a> a score and with
3&nbsp;points against them, and, by the kind of football that has
made Yost teams famous, played the &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; to a standstill.
Michigan was returned a winner by a score of 15 to 3. The game
brought out Jimmie Craig in the new r&ocirc;le of halfback and assured
him a permanent berth behind the line. Six hundred Michigan
rooters attended the game.</p>

Vanderbilt eleven on Ferry Field Saturday, <abbr title="October the twenty-eighth">Oct.&nbsp;28</abbr>, and it was
by the closest of margins that the Wolverines won out by a 9 to

a touchdown, but Michigan was more fortunate than her southern
rivals in that McMillan made a perfect punt-out and Conklin
kicked goal, while Captain Roy Morrison of Vanderbilt fell down
on the same play and lost his team the chance to try for a goal
from touchdown when he overkicked on the punt-out. Yost was far
from satisfied by the showing of the Michigan team.</p>

<h3><abbr title="9">IX.</abbr>&nbsp;Model&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II.</abbr></h3>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, October&nbsp;<abbr title="the ninth">9</abbr>, 1913.&mdash;Cornelius McGillicuddy&#8217;s Murder
Association, incorporated, convened at the Polo grounds this
afternoon, transacted routine business, and adjourned.</p>

<p>On motion of Brother Edward Collins, supported by<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;58">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a> Brother J.
Franklin Baker, and carried by acclamation, it was voted to
resume the task of tearing the hide off the Giants. Messrs.
Collins and Baker were appointed a special committee of two to
carry out the work and seven others were assigned to assist
them.</p>

<p>After the meeting refreshments consisting of singles, doubles,
triples, and home runs were served; and a good time was had by
all, excepting John J. McGraw and his employes and
friends numbering upward of 25,000. The latter class was
unanimous in declaring the Mackmen a bunch of vulgar, common
persons who play professional baseball for a living and thus are
not entitled to associate with amateurs, such as some of the New
York players.</p>

<p>To get to the point of things, Philadelphia had what some of the
fans called &ldquo;one of them afternoons.&rdquo; There is no use trying to
describe all the details of this so-called contest, for it is
demoralizing to the young to see such things in print. Many
criminals have confessed on the scaffold that they got their
start watching the Athletics assault some honest young pitcher
who was trying to support his aged mother. They say that, if the
Macks can get away with their rough work, anything ought to go.</p>

<p>Eight to two was the score to-day, if anybody cares. We can&#8217;t
just figure out where New York got the two, but it was there on
the score board and must have happened. Also there is a
well-grounded belief that McGraw has subsidized the scoreboard
boy so that he cheats the visitors somewhat. But, anyhow, it is
reasonably certain that the Mackmen had plenty, while New York
was several shy of the total that would have cheered the heart
of Gotham, if indeed Gotham has a heart.</p>

<p>Connie Mack and John J. McGraw each had to do some guessing
to-day in the matter of picking a pitcher. Lean Connie picked up
the right answer and Fat John did not. There&#8217;s the whole story.
The Philadelphia boss shook up the names of his young pitchers
in a hat, shut his eyes, and drew out the name of Joe Bush.
McGraw, by and with the consent and advice of his entire club,
picked Jeff Tesreau. At least it was popularly believed, during
and before the game started, that John had given his mound corps
a careful slant and chosen Jeff as the best bet. Afterward some
of the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;59">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a> experts believed that the New York manager, by way of
showing a delicate bit of courtesy to a guest, had accorded
Connie the privilege of naming New York&#8217;s gunner. Certainly
Tesreau was the best player Philadelphia had and the Athletics
were seriously crippled when he retired in the seventh, just
after Baker had knocked Doyle&#8217;s right leg out into the field.</p>

<p>About all that Tesreau had was a fine physique and a mouthful of
slippery elm. Almost before the umpires and managers had ceased
to chat over the rules, the Macks had lumped three hits, and
with a wild heave by Artie Fletcher had scored three runs, which
was one more than the Giants got all day. In the next inning
some more hammering gave another pair of markers. Then Tesreau
settled down and went along fairly well until the seventh. The
Athletics had another rush of hits to the outfield in this
inning and Otis Crandall came in to finish up the contest, or
scandal, whichever you choose to term it. By this time Connie&#8217;s
men were getting hungry for supper, so they made only one tally
off Crandall, this coming when Wallie Schang bakered one into
the right field stand.</p>

<p>Of course, under such conditions, Joe Bush didn&#8217;t have a real
test. Connie Mack himself, or his crippled batboy, could have
pitched the game and won it from the second inning on. Joe just
kept slamming them over and, though he had a couple of wild
spells that gave the Giants a chance to figure in the game, he
always was able to pull himself together before there was any
real danger.</p>

<p>Nobody here had heard much about this Joe Bush previous to
to-day. Even the experts, who see all things that are and a lot
that aren&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t have the dope on him. They had heard of
Donie Bush and Anheuser Busch and Bush leaguers, but Joseph was
a new one. For the information and guidance of those who may be
interested, we furnish the data that he came From the Missoula
Club of the Union&mdash;or is it Onion&mdash;Association last fall, and is
a right hander.</p>

<p>Bush has the reputation of being almost as speedy as Walter
Johnson on his good days and this was one of them. In the early
stages of the game he depended almost entirely on his fast ball
but later began to unbelt a few curves which had the right sort
of a fold to them. Although in a hole with<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;60">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a> many batters, he
passed only four and hit one. Great fielding helped him at
times, the Macks pulling off a double play in each of three
innings in which New York appeared to have something started.</p>

<p>Any child wonder who can come all the way from Missoula to
Broadway in one year and win a world&#8217;s series game is of course
entitled to much credit, but this boy certainly fell into a
particularly soft spot. With the Macks&#8217; billion dollar infield
killing base hits for him and the attack getting him eight runs,
he would have had a hard time slipping the game to McGraw if he
had sold out before hostilities started. Bush permitted the
Giants, who were commonly reported to be moaning for the gore of
Mack&#8217;s youngsters, just five hits. Two of these were bunched in
one inning and resulted in one of the runs. The others straggled
through.<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<li>In this report we have a good example of baseball reporting

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Report</span> a speech, lecture, or sermon in two hundred words.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Explanation</h3>

<p>It is easy to obtain the material for this assignment because one has
only to attend, listen, and take notes. Indeed, in some instances,
speakers are ready and willing to furnish reporters with copies of what
they intend to say. The part of the task which requires skill is what is
known as boiling down, condensing, or reducing the report to the
dimensions required by editors. This involves: first and foremost, a
determination not to misrepresent in any way what is said; second, the
ability to select the essential points; third, an eye for such detail as
may be used to spice the report without making it too long. Too many
reporters, in their anxiety to make a good story, observe only the last
of these requirements, and in consequence are unjust to speakers. In the
arrangement of the material, it is well to begin with a statement of the
main point of the speech and to follow it with such details as space
permits.</p>


<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;64">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Speech Construction</h3>

<p>Every good speech, however long, has only one main point. Its details
serve only to illustrate and enforce this central theme. The reporter
needs to bear this in mind. He must discover the central point, or
thesis, before he can write a good report. A knowledge of the principles
underlying speech construction is therefore of great value to him, even
if not essential. Fortunately, these are comparatively simple. Nearly
every good speech, from <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Demosthenes</span> down, has consisted of the following
parts in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li><em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exordium</span>, or Introduction.</em> A bridge from the audience to
the subject, designed to conciliate and interest.</li>

<li><em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Status</span>, or Plan.</em> An outline of what the speaker intends to
say.</li>

<li><em>Statement of Facts.</em> A presentation of the situation on
which the orator intends to found his argument.</li>

<li><em>Argument.</em> Here is presented in detail the plan or
conclusion which the speaker has in mind, with the reasons
in favor of it.</li>

<li><em>Refutation.</em> A reply to objections which have been or may
be urged against the plan.</li>

<li><em>Peroration, or Conclusion.</em> This may be a summary of the
speech, a good-humored bit of color, a picture of the
benefits to be derived from the adoption of the orator&#8217;s
plan, or an impassioned appeal for action.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sermons and political speeches are usually argumentative and hence of
this type. Sometimes, however, an orator and his theme are so well known
that he omits all except 3 and 4; occasionally all except 4 disappear.
Lectures often contain only 3, as their purpose is only to convey
information. Usually, however, a speech without an argument is like a
gas engine without gas; it has no &ldquo;go.&rdquo; The speech that<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;65">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a> does not aim to
get people to do something is usually flat, stale, and unprofitable.</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Models</h3>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="1">I</abbr></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, March&nbsp;<abbr title="the twenty-second">22</abbr>, 1775.&mdash;Conciliation as a means of allaying the
present discontent in the American colonies was advocated in the
House of Commons to-day by Mr. Edmund Burke. He proposed that
Parliament abandon the idea of taxing the colonies, and instead
place on the statute book an act acknowledging that the various
colonial legislative bodies have the power to grant or refuse
aids to the crown. Though his speech, which lasted over three
hours, was heard with respect, the measures which he proposed
were defeated by a strict party vote, 270 to 78.</p>

<p>Mr. Burke spoke with a dignity and power which have not been
surpassed even by the Earl of Chatham. His mastery of the
subject was so complete and the form of his speech so perfect
that competent judges pronounce it a classic. His speech is to
be printed at once as a pamphlet.</p>

<p>In outline Mr. Burke said: &ldquo;As I have studied this American
question for years, have held fixed opinions on it since 1766,
and have nothing to gain except disgrace if I suggest a foolish
solution of the problem, I believe that you will hear me with
patience. My speech will consist of the discussion of two
questions: (1) Should we attempt to conciliate the Americans?
(2) If so, how? America is already powerful by virtue of
population, commerce, and agriculture. The chief characteristic
of the American people is their fierce love of freedom. There
are only three ways to deal with this spirit: (1) To remove it
by removing its causes; (2) to punish it as criminal; (3) to
comply with it as necessary. Its causes are irremovable, being
the love of independence which caused their ancestors to leave
England; their religion in the North, which is the Protestantism
of the Protestant religion; the fact that in the South they hold
slaves; the general diffusion among them of education; the
circumstance that they speak English and that an Englishman is
the unfittest man on earth to argue another Englishman into
being a slave; and<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;66">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a> the 3000&nbsp;miles of ocean, between us and
them. It cannot be treated as criminal, there being no way to
draw up an indictment against a whole nation. Indeed, you have
already tried to do this and failed. There remains no way of
treating the American spirit except to comply with it as
necessary. I propose, therefore, to erect a Temple of British
Concord with six massive pillars by granting to America in six
propositions the identical rights which for generations have
been by acts of Parliament secured to Ireland, Wales, Chester,
and Durham, except that, owing to the distance of America from
England, each colony, instead of sending members to Parliament,
shall have the power, through its own legislature, to grant or
refuse aids to the Crown. If adopted, these measures, I believe,
will substitute an immediate and lasting peace for the disorders
which Lord North&#8217;s measures have created. The unbought loyalty
of a free people, thus secured, will give us more revenue than
any coercive measure. Indeed, it is the only cement that can
hold together the British Empire.&rdquo; </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="2">II</abbr></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <abbr title="September the twentieth">Sept.&nbsp;20</abbr>, 1887.&mdash;Edmund Burke was the theme of a
lecture delivered last night before the Edinburgh Philosophical
Society by Mr. Augustine Birrell. &ldquo;Nobody is fit to govern this
country who has not drunk deep at the springs of Burke,&rdquo; said
Mr. Birrell, and he backed up this contention with a wealth of
wit and argument which delighted and convinced his audience.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of his lecture: &ldquo;To give a full
account of Burke&#8217;s public life is no part of my plan. I propose
merely to sketch his early career, to explain why he never
obtained a seat in the cabinet, and to essay an analysis of the
essential elements of his greatness. Born in 1729 in Dublin, he
grew up with a brother who speculated and a sister of a type who
never did any man any serious harm; acquired at school a brogue
which death alone could silence; at Trinity College, Dublin,
became an omnivorous reader; came in 1750 to London to study
law, armed with a cultivated curiosity and no desperate
determination to make his fortune; immediately, like the
sensible Irishman he was, fell<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;67">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a> in love with Peg Woffington; for
six years rambled everywhere his purse permitted, read
everything he could lay his hands on, and talked everlastingly;
in 1756 published an &lsquo;Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful,&rsquo; and
married Miss Jane Mary Nugent; in 1758 dared at David Garrick&#8217;s
dinner table to contradict Dr. Johnson; in 1765 became a member
of Parliament; and for the next sixteen years was the life and
soul of the Whig party. When that party, in 1782, finally came
into power, Burke&#8217;s only reward, however, was a minor office, a
fact which, in view of his great merits, has amazed posterity.
The explanation is that his contemporaries probably knew him,
not as a commanding genius, but as an Irishman who was always in
debt, whose relatives were rather disreputable, whose judgment
was often wrong, and whose temper was violent. His significance
for us grows from the fact that he applied the imagination of a
poet of the first order to the business of life. He saw
organized society steadily and saw it whole. Perceiving that
only a thin crust of conventionality protects organized society
from the volcanic heats of anarchy, he was afraid of reformers.
He could not agree to dispense with the protection afforded by
the huge mountains of prejudice and the ancient rivers of
custom. He was the High Priest of Order. He loved justice and
hated iniquity. The world needs his wisdom to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Birrell&#8217;s lecture was full of good phrases. For instance:</p>

<ol>
<li>We have the spectacle of Burke in his old age, like another
Laoco&ouml;n, writhing and wrestling with the French Revolution.</li>

<li>Lubricating religious differences with the sweet oil of the
domestic affections.</li>

<li>Quaint old landladies wonder maternally why he never gets
drunk, and generally mistake him for an author until he pays
his bill.</li>

<li>I love him for letting me warm my hands at it (his wrath at
Gerard Hamilton) after a lapse of a hundred and twenty
years.</li>

<li>His letters to Arthur Young on the subject of carrots still
tremble with emotion.</li>

<li>This is magnificent, but it is not farming.</li>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Write</span> a notice of one of the plays now on the local stage.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Explanation</h3>

<p>To keep its readers informed of the character of the plays being
presented at local theaters is one of the functions of the newspaper. If
the play is a classic, only the quality of the acting need be discussed.
If it is new, the notice should also include a description of the play
and of its merit. Fortunately, this can always be determined by one
simple test&mdash;a test suggested by no less a critic than William
Shakespeare: Does it hold the mirror up to nature? Does it give, in
other words, an accurate picture of life? The stage, it may be added,
always has been and is now infested by many so-called plays which are
not plays at all, but mere conglomerations of more or less (usually
less) moral and amusing jokes and antics. The events which some of them
depict could occur neither on the earth, in the sky above the earth, nor
in the waters underneath the earth. From others it would be impossible
to cut out any character or scene without improving the whole. They fill
the theater with people and the manager&#8217;s pocket-book with money, but
they are not plays.</p>

<p><cite>The Melting Pot</cite> comes to New York with a Chicago indorsement
and the authority lent by the name of Mr. Israel Zangwill, as
author. Mr. Zangwill&#8217;s theme is that the United States is a
crucible in which all the races and nationalities of the world
are to be fused into one glorious people.</p>

<p>As a play <cite>The Melting Pot</cite> has the intellectual tone to be
expected from Mr. Zangwill. It also has really poetic touches.
In humor it is less successful. In dramatic construction it is
faulty, as are so many of the contemporary plays which try to
teach or preach something.</p>

<p>The play brings back to New York after a long absence that
excellent actor, Mr. Walker Whiteside.&mdash;<cite class="smcap">Metcalfe</cite> in <cite>Life</cite>

<blockquote><h4><abbr title="2">II</abbr></h4>

<p>Of <cite>David Copperfield</cite>, Dickens&#8217;s favorite among his own works,
there have been dramatizations almost innumerable. The latest,
called the <cite>Highway of Life</cite>, by Louis N. Parker, author of
<cite>Pomander Walk</cite> and <cite>Disraeli</cite>, has been done with extreme
reverence for the text and with an elaborate scenic investiture
that would have made glad the heart of the novelist, enamored as
he was of the theater.</p>

<p>It was to have been the autumn offering at His Majesty&#8217;s in
London, with Sir Herbert Tree doubling as <cite>Micawber</cite> and <cite>Dan&#8217;l
Peggotty</cite>. The war caused a change of plans, so the first
performance on any stage took place at Wallack&#8217;s in New York.
Lennox Pawle, Mr. Parker&#8217;s son-in-law, realized a long-cherished
ambition to step forth as <cite>Micawber</cite>. Fresh from his
multimillionaire of <cite>The Money Makers</cite>, came Emmet Corrigan for
<cite>Dan&#8217;l Peggotty</cite>. <cite>Betsey Trotwood</cite> fell to Eva Vincent. The
Lieblers were especially happy in their selection of a <cite>Mrs.
Micawber</cite> in the person of Maggie Holloway Fisher. She spent
days digging out and fashioning the costume she wears, and no
one ever murdered a song more successfully than she at David&#8217;s
dinner-party. An astonishingly faithful imitation of her
languishing airs is given by Philip<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;73">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a> Tonge, when, as <cite>Traddles</cite>,
he reads <cite>Micawber&#8217;s</cite> letter. J.&nbsp;V. Bryant, the <cite>Copperfield</cite>,
and Vernon Steele, the <cite>Steerforth</cite>, are both English. O.&nbsp;P.
Heggie deserves more than a passing word of commendation for the
things he refrains from doing as <cite>Uriah Heep</cite>. He is not forever
going through that waterless washing of the hands.</p>

<p>There are ten different sets of scenery in <cite>The Highway of
Life</cite>, all charming or effective as the case may be. For the
background of Mr. Wickfield&#8217;s garden at Canterbury we have a
glimpse of the famous cathedral, and from <cite>Betsey Trotwood&#8217;s</cite>
domain we get a view of the chalk cliffs and downs at Dover. A
happy conceit throws shadow pictures of the principal characters
upon a sheet as they cross the stage just before the first
curtain rises.&mdash;<cite class="smcap">Matthew White, Jr.</cite>, in <cite>Munsey&#8217;s</cite>

<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Organization</h3>

<p>From the following list of paragraph topics, select those which are best
worth discussing in connection with the play which you desire to review.</p>

<p>Select those about which you can get the fullest information.</p>

<ol class="middle">
<li>The Four W&#8217;s.</li>

<li>Philosophy.</li>
<li>The Actors.</li>
<li>The Scenery.</li>
<li>Character Portrayal.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the play is noteworthy for its poetry, its wit, or its philosophy,
these should be illustrated by one or two quotations. If the chief
interest is in the story, tell the story. If its strength is derived
from the skill of the actors, from the setting, or from character
portrayal, devote your attention to a clear exposition of these phases
of the play. Do not permit your notice to be shorter than <abbr title="1">I</abbr> nor longer
than <abbr title="2">II.</abbr></p>

<p>If, for any reason, it seems unwise to send pupils to a play, they might
be requested (1) to present the following program, or some modification
of it, as typical of Shakespeare&#8217;s best work, and (2) to write notices
or critiques thereon. It is perhaps unnecessary to add that no more
profitable or delightful exercise can be devised for a class.</p>

<h4>THE ART OF ACTING</h4>

<p><cite>Hamlet.</cite> Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but, if you mouth it, as many of
your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use
all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;76">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a> fellow tear a passion
to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,
who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for
o&#8217;erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</p>

<p><cite>First Player.</cite> I warrant your honour.</p>

<p><cite>Hamlet.</cite> Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the
action; with this special observance, that you o&#8217;erstep not the
modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose
of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to
hold, as &#8217;twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own
feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the
time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy
off, though it make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the
judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your
allowance o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that
highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the
accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man,
have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature&#8217;s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they
imitated humanity so abominably.</p>

<p><cite>First Player.</cite> I hope we have reformed that indifferently with
us, sir.</p>

<p><cite>Hamlet.</cite> O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your
clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of
them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of
barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some
necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that&#8217;s
villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that
uses it. Go, make you ready.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune; but to write
and read comes by nature.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite class="smcap">Shakespeare.</cite></p></blockquote>


<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> most of his material a reporter must rely upon his success as an
interviewer. This, it has already been pointed out, requires courage,
tact, persistence, and some knowledge of human nature. Its performance
is beyond the powers of most boys and girls, and besides, if they tried
it, they would annoy people. As a substitute, the exercises that follow
have been devised. They involve interviews, it is true, but only with
the members of a pupil&#8217;s own family.</p>

<p>There are two ways to manage an interview. One may go directly at it,
which is sometimes the best method, or one may approach the subject
cautiously. It depends on the disposition of the person interviewed. The
direct method will probably work well with mother, who is never out of
sorts, but as to father&mdash;well, the case may be different; while sisters,
brothers, cousins, aunts, and uncles present endless problems and
opportunities.</p>

<p>Before interviewing anybody, it is a good plan always to write down the
questions you wish to ask. But do not read them to the person
interviewed. Get them so thoroughly into your own mind that you will
forget none of them. As an exercise, make a set of questions such as you
would need to ask in order to<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;78">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a> learn the facts contained in the
following paragraphs from Franklin&#8217;s <cite>Autobiography</cite>.</p>

<h4>MY ANCESTORS</h4>

<p>One of my uncles furnished me with several particulars relating
to our ancestors. From his notes I learned that the family had
lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three
hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the
time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an
order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others
took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about
thirty acres, aided by the smith&#8217;s business, which had continued
in the family until his time, the eldest son being always bred
to that business, a custom which he and my father followed as to
their eldest sons. When I searched the records of Ecton, I found
an account of their births, marriages, and burials from the year
1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any
time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the
youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My
grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he
grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live
with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom
my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather died
and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son
Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to
his only child, a daughter. My grandfather had four sons that
grew up, viz: Thomas, John, Benjamin, and Josiah. I will give
you what account I can of them.</p></blockquote>

<h4>MY UNCLES</h4>

<p>Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious,
and encouraged in learning (as all my uncles were) by an
Esquire, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he
qualified himself for the business of scrivener; became a
considerable man in the county; was a chief mover of all
public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of
Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were
related of him, and much taken notice of and patronized by the
then Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January&nbsp;<abbr title="the sixth">6</abbr>, old style, just
four years to a day before I was born. The account we received
of his life and character from some old people at Ecton, I
remember, struck you as something extraordinary. &ldquo;Had he died on
the same day,&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;one might have supposed a
transmigration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John was bred a dyer, I believe, of woolens. Benjamin was bred a
silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an
ingenious man. I remember him well, for when he was a boy he
came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with us
for some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel
Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto
volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional
pieces addressed to his friends and relations. He had formed a
shorthand of his own, which he taught me; but, never practicing
it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there
being a particular affection between him and my father. He was
very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers,
which he took down in his shorthand. He was also much of a
politician. </p></blockquote>

<p>Write an account of your uncles. Make it as rich as possible in concrete
facts, for facts are the life and soul of composition. Let the length be
about the same as that of the model. Note that Franklin discusses his
uncles in an order determined by the principle that first and last
places are the most conspicuous. He put the uncle about whom he knows
most in last place, so as to have a strong ending, which grows, so to
speak, to a climax; he puts the uncle who is entitled to second place
first in order of discussion; and the uncle who is least important is
mentioned in the middle.</p>

<h4>MY PARENTS</h4>

<p>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with
three children into New England about 1682. The conventicles
having been forbidden by law and frequently disturbed induced
some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that
country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither,
where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with
freedom. By the same wife he had four children more born there,
and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen, of whom I
remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew
up to be men and women and married. I was the youngest son and
the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England.
My mother, the second, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter
Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom
honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather, in his church
history of that country, as &ldquo;a godly, pious, learned
Englishman.&rdquo; I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional
pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many
years since. It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of
that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in
the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience
and in behalf of the Baptists,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;82">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a> Quakers, and other sectaries
that had been under persecution. The whole appeared to me to be
written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom.
The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the
two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was that his
censures proceeded from good will and therefore he would be
known to be the author:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<blockquote><p>The new suburban home of John Doe is located in a ten-acre tract
on the northern side of the Seven-Mile Road, midway between
Woodward Avenue and the Gratiot E. Turnpike. The material is
reinforced concrete; the style, Colonial; the roof of green
shingles; the size, 48&nbsp;feet by 36&nbsp;feet.</p>

<p>From a front entrance porch a central hall 7&nbsp;feet wide extends
29&nbsp;feet to the rear of the house, terminating in a flight of
stairs broken in the middle by a landing. Above this landing a
circular window gives plenty of light and at the same time forms
a decorative feature.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;85">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>On the right, as one enters the hall, is a room 9&nbsp;feet by
14&nbsp;feet, which may be used as a den or a reception room. Back of
this is a living-room, 14&nbsp;feet by 20&nbsp;feet, with a fireplace at
the rear end, and a French door that leads to a side piazza.
This piazza, which is 20&nbsp;feet by 7&nbsp;feet, is covered and is
equipped with sliding windows.</p>

<p>On the other side of the hall, in front, is the dining-room,
16&nbsp;feet by 14&nbsp;feet. This room has a fireplace, which faces the
street, and a French door, which leads to a side porch 8&nbsp;feet by
10. The latter is enclosed with glass and is used as a breakfast
porch. Directly behind this porch is a small sewing-room, and,
partly behind the sewing-room and partly behind the dining-room,
is the kitchen, which is 12&nbsp;feet square. In the northwest corner
of the house, directly north of the sewing-room and west of the
kitchen, are a small back porch and an entry large enough for a
refrigerator. East of the kitchen, between it and the main hall,
are a passage and service stairways leading to the cellar and
the upper floors. The kitchen is thus separated from the rest of
the house, either way, by two doors, which prevents the odors of
the cooking from escaping.</p>

<p>The walls of the first floor are finished in oiled and waxed
gumwood. The floors are oak, except in the kitchen, where hard
pine is used.</p>

<p>On the second floor the rear of the space above the main hall is
occupied by a passage, the front by a bathroom. On the eastern
side of this passage, above the den, is a bedroom 16&nbsp;feet by
14&nbsp;feet, and back of this, above the living-room, a bedroom
14&nbsp;feet by 11&nbsp;feet. The latter has a fireplace in the north
wall. On the western side of the passage, in front, above the
dining-room, is the owner&#8217;s chamber, 16&nbsp;feet by 14&nbsp;feet. From
its southeast corner a door leads to the bathroom already
mentioned; on its southwest side is a porch, and in its northern
wall are two closets and a fireplace. In its rear a passage
leads to a fourth chamber, 14&nbsp;feet by 10&nbsp;feet, which has an
alcove, 9&nbsp;feet by 8&nbsp;feet. This alcove is directly above the
sewing-room and the chamber is in the northwest corner of the
house. Between it and the service stairway is a second bathroom.</p>

<p>On the third floor are three large chambers, an unfinished room
for storage, and a servants&#8217; bath.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;86">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>The cellar contains a laundry, a vegetable closet, coal-bins,

<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Gathering Material</h3>

<p>Do not get your material from reading; get it from observation. Don&#8217;t
steal it; earn it. Catch your fish; don&#8217;t buy a string of dead ones at
the fish-market, and then lie about the way you obtained them. Few of us
can be original, but we can all be honest and industrious.</p>


<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;88">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>&nbsp;Organization</h3>

<p>Before you write, make a plan. It is as necessary in composition as in
building. If the nature of your subject or the kind and quantity of your
material render it desirable to deviate from the model, do not hesitate
to do so. As a rule, however, it will be best to follow its plan rather

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> exposition of ideas is difficult and important. It takes many forms,
but only three can be noticed in this chapter: (1) Exposition through
Narration; (2) Exposition through Condensation; (3) Exposition through
Comparison. The three following models illustrate these three forms,
respectively.</p>

<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Model&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr></h3>

<blockquote>
<h4>PUFFERS</h4>

<p>The wise men of antiquity loved to convey instruction under the
covering of apologue; and, though this practice is generally
thought childish, we shall make no apology for adopting it on
the present occasion. A generation which has bought eleven
editions of a poem by Mr. Robert Montgomery may well condescend
to listen to a fable of Pilpay.</p>

<p>A pious Brahmin, it is written, made a vow that on a certain day
he would sacrifice a sheep, and on the appointed morning he went
forth to buy one. There lived in his neighborhood three rogues
who knew of his vow, and laid a scheme for profiting by it. The
first met him and said, &ldquo;Oh Brahmin, wilt thou buy a sheep? I
have one fit for sacrifice.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is for that very purpose,&rdquo; said
the holy man, &ldquo;that I came forth this day.&rdquo; Then the impostor
opened a bag, and brought out of it an unclean beast, an ugly
dog, lame and blind. Thereon the Brahmin cried out, &ldquo;Wretch, who
touchest things impure, and utterest things untrue,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;91">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a> callest
thou that cur a sheep?&rdquo; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;it is a
sheep of the finest fleece and of the sweetest flesh. O Brahmin,
it will be an offering most acceptable to the gods.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo;
said the Brahmin, &ldquo;either thou or I must be blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then one of the accomplices came up. &ldquo;Praised be the gods,&rdquo;
said this second rogue, &ldquo;that I have been saved the trouble of
going to the market for a sheep! This is such a sheep as I
wanted. For how much wilt thou sell it?&rdquo; When the Brahmin heard
this his mind waved to and fro, like one swinging in the air at
a holy festival. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to the newcomer, &ldquo;take heed what
thou dost; this is no sheep, but an unclean cur.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Brahmin,&rdquo;
said the newcomer, &ldquo;thou art drunk or mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this time the third confederate drew near. &ldquo;Let us ask this
man,&rdquo; said the Brahmin, &ldquo;what the creature is, and I will stand
by what he shall say.&rdquo; To this the others agreed, and the
Brahmin called out, &ldquo;O stranger, what dost thou call this
beast?&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely, O Brahmin,&rdquo; said the knave, &ldquo;it is a fine
sheep.&rdquo; Then the Brahmin said, &ldquo;Surely the gods have taken away
my senses&rdquo;; and he asked pardon of him who carried the dog, and
bought it for a measure of rice and a pot of ghee, and offered
it up to the gods, who, being wroth at this unclean sacrifice,
smote him with a sore disease in all his joints.</p>

<p>Thus, or nearly thus, if we remember rightly, runs the story of
the Sanscrit &AElig;sop. The moral, like the moral of every fable that
is worth the telling, lies on the surface. The writer evidently
means to caution us against the practices of puffers, a class of
people who have more than once talked the public into the most
absurd errors, but who surely never played a more curious or a
more difficult trick than when they passed Mr. Robert Montgomery
off upon the world as a great poet.&mdash;<cite class="smcap">Thomas Babington Macaulay</cite>,

<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Topics for Discussion</h3>

<ol>
<li>The Fable, which is here illustrated, is a simple story told
to point a moral or to make clear a complicated situation.
&AElig;sop and George Ade are perhaps the most<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;92">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a> interesting
authors of fables&mdash;at least to twentieth-century Americans.
An entertaining program may be arranged by assigning each
member of the class a fable of one of these writers for oral
reporting. The model illustrates well the value of the fable
form in newspaper exposition.</li>

<li>Note the paragraph structure: (1) Introduction; (2) &ldquo;Four
W&#8217;s,&rdquo; or Situation&nbsp;1; (3) Climax, or Situation&nbsp;2; (4)
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&eacute;nouement</span>, Result, or Situation&nbsp;3; (5) Moral, or Point.</li>

<li>Define and discuss the etymology of &ldquo;antiquity,&rdquo; &ldquo;apologue,&rdquo;
&ldquo;apology,&rdquo; &ldquo;edition,&rdquo; &ldquo;fable,&rdquo; &ldquo;impostor,&rdquo; &ldquo;accomplice,&rdquo;
&ldquo;confederate,&rdquo; &ldquo;knave,&rdquo; &ldquo;ghee,&rdquo; &ldquo;caution,&rdquo; &ldquo;puffers.&rdquo;</li>

<li>What proportion of Macaulay&#8217;s words in Paragraphs 2, 3, and
4 are monosyllables and dissyllables? Does he here use more
or fewer big words in proportion than in Paragraphs 1 and 5?
What is the effect on his style?</li>

<li>What proportion of his sentences are simple? Compound?
Complex?</li>

<li>Topics for reports or speeches: Mr. Robert Montgomery;
Pilpay; The Brahmins; &AElig;sop; Sanscrit.</li>

<li>Explain the allusion in the phrase, &ldquo;the Sanscrit &AElig;sop.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Explain some episode in American history by means of a

<blockquote><p>A Voltairean view of war may be of interest at this time. Some
one has called attention to the illuminating discourse between
Micromegas, gigantic dweller on one of the planets revolving
about Sirius, and a company of our philosophers, as reported in
the seventh chapter of the amusing fantasy bearing the name of
the above-mentioned Sirian visitor. A free translation of a part
of this conversation is here offered. After congratulating his
terrestrial hearers on being so small and adding that, with so
manifest a subordination<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;93">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a> of matter to mind, they must pass
their lives in the pleasures of intellectual pursuits and mutual
love&mdash;a veritable spiritual existence&mdash;the stranger is thus
answered by one of the philosophers: &ldquo;We have more matter than
we need for the accomplishment of much evil, if evil comes from
matter, and more mind than we need if evil comes from mind. Do
you know that at the present moment there are a hundred thousand
fools of our species, wearing caps, who are killing a hundred
thousand other animals wearing turbans, or who are themselves
being massacred by the latter, and that almost everywhere on
earth this is the immemorial usage?&rdquo; The Sirian, properly
shocked, demands the reason of these horrible encounters between
creatures so puny. &ldquo;It is all about a pile of dirt no bigger
than your heel,&rdquo; is the reply. &ldquo;Not that any one of these
millions of men marching to slaughter has the slightest claim to
this pile of dirt; the only question is whether it shall belong
to a certain man known as Sultan or to another having the title
of Czar. Neither of the two has ever seen or ever will see the
patch of ground in dispute, and hardly a single one of these
animals engaged in killing one another has ever seen the animal
for whom they are thus employed.&rdquo; Again the stranger expresses
his horror, and declares he has half a mind to annihilate with a
kick or two the whole batch of ridiculous assassins. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t give
yourself the trouble,&rdquo; is the rejoinder; &ldquo;they will accomplish
their own destruction fast enough. Know that ten years hence not
a hundredth part of these miserable wretches will be left alive;
and know, too, that even if they were not to draw the sword,
hunger, exhaustion, or intemperance would make an end of most of
them. Besides, they are not the ones to punish, but rather those
sedentary barbarians who, from the ease and security of their
private apartments, and while their dinner is digesting, order
the massacre of a million men, and then solemnly return thanks
to God for the achievement.&rdquo; The visitor from Sirius is moved
with pity for a race of beings presenting such astonishing
contrasts.&mdash;<cite>The Dial</cite>, January&nbsp;<abbr title="the first">1</abbr>, 1915.<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9"></a><a title="Go to footnote 9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> </p></blockquote>

<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Model&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr></h3>

<blockquote><p>Theodor Mommsen&#8217;s &ldquo;Law of National Expansion,&rdquo; in view of the
present war, is interesting. In his <cite>History of Rome</cite>, which was
published in 1857, he says in substance that a young nation
which has both vigor and culture is sure to absorb older nations
whose vigor is waning and younger nations whose civilization is
undeveloped, just as an educated young man is sure to supplant
an old man in his dotage and to get the better of a muscular
ignoramus. That nations, as well as individuals, should do this
is, in Mommsen&#8217;s opinion, not only inevitable but right.</p>

<p>In ancient times the Romans were the only people in whom were
combined a superior political organization and a superior
civilization. The result was that they subdued the Greek states
of the East, which were ripe for destruction, and dispossessed
the people of lower grades of culture in the West. The union of
Italy was accomplished through the overthrow of the Samnite and
Etruscan civilizations. The Roman Empire was built upon the
ruins of countless secondary nationalities which had long before
been marked out for destruction by the levelling hand of
civilization. When <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latium</span> became too narrow for the Romans, they
cured their political ills by conquering the rest of Italy. When
Italy became too narrow, C&aelig;sar crossed the Alps.</p>

<p>So far Mommsen. The conclusions drawn from his &ldquo;law&rdquo;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;95">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a> by some of
his successors are ingenious. They amount to this: As Rome grew
in power and culture, so Brandenburg, since the days of the
Great Elector, has been expanding in spirit and in territory.
That illustrious prince began by absorbing Prussia. Frederick
the Great added Silesia and a slice of Poland. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wilhelm</span>&nbsp;<abbr title="the first">I</abbr>
obtained <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schleswig, Holstein</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alsace</span>, and Lorraine by war, and
Saxony and Bavaria by benevolent assimilation. The present
Kaiser has already acquired Belgium by the former and Austria by
the latter process. Like the Rome of C&aelig;sar, the German Empire is
now at war on the one hand with decadent civilizations and on
the other with a horde of barbarians. What Greece and Carthage
were to Rome, France and England are to Germany, while Russia is
the modern counterpart of the Gauls, Britons, and Germans of the
<cite>Commentaries</cite>. Such at least is what certain writers think the
Germans think. </p></blockquote>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> editorial is a newspaper article in which the opinions of the editor
are set forth. News deals with fact. In news articles the opinion of the
writer must be suppressed. The pronouns &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rdquo; have no place in
news. The essence of the editorial, on the other hand, is the opinion of
the writer. On the editorial page, the man who directs the policy of a
paper seeks to interpret the news in accordance with his own views and
to persuade the public to adopt those views.</p>

<p>Editorials are therefore for the most part argumentative. In them the
writer either comments directly on some news item and thus produces what
may be called a constructive editorial, or takes issue with the
editorial opinion of a rival in a controversial editorial, his object
being to destroy the sentiment produced by his rival&#8217;s article.</p>

<p>The power of the editorial writer for good or for evil is clear. That it
is usually exerted for good is one of the best evidences that the
newspapers of the country are controlled by men who desire to serve the
public well.</p>

<blockquote><p>We made the point some months ago that our electric light
companies have been far behind those of Europe in making it
possible for poor people to get their service. It is interesting
to note that the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company, which
operates in South Bend, Ind. (plows, wagons, sewing-machines),
has started a campaign to do just this thing. About a third of
the inhabitants of South Bend are laborers from Poland, Austria,
and the Balkan countries, whose wages average about $1.50 or
$1.75 per day. The electric company has figured out plans
whereby houses can be wired at a cost of from $9 to $15 each,
and lighting service can be given for a minimum of $1 per month.
A Polish sales agent has been hired to talk to the newcomers,
write advertisements for their papers, and attend to their
complaints&mdash;in short, to translate electricity into Slovak, etc.
The men engaged in the work are confident of success and are
going after it. The effect in giving these people better ways
and standards of living, in getting them a share in our modern
American civilization, and a feeling that they are so sharing
will necessarily be very great. This is solid public service,
and it is far better than any charity. What is being done on

<blockquote><p>Were we suddenly called upon to face a crisis such as Europe was
called upon to face with but very little warning, it would find
us wofully unprepared. In the security of our peace
we have neglected to build up an organization capable of
performing the multitudinous services of war, or of any great
disaster, either political or physical, which may come into a
nation&#8217;s life. The thousands of young men in colleges and
universities offer a field for the development of such a force
of trained men in a way that would entirely revolutionize our
educational as well as our defensive system.</p>

<p>As our athletics are conducted to-day, a few picked men have
trainers, coaches, rubbers, and waiters for the purpose of
preparing them for a conflict with a correspondingly small group
of similarly trained men from other institutions. The remainder
of the student body, which makes this training possible, is
meanwhile physically utterly neglected.</p>

<p>Yet the average young man entering college is quite as much in
need of physical development and training as of mental. The
country, too, is in need of disciplined, trained men; and this
double need can be met&mdash;can be met for less money than is
expended on a single season&#8217;s football team. A system of
military drill, under the supervision of experts in military
discipline and hygiene, with the co&ouml;peration of the athletic
associations of the colleges, and under the auspices of the
United States Government, would prove of inestimable value to
every student in the college, and would furnish to the nation a
groundwork upon which a magnificent national service could be
established. A spirit of true patriotism and of unselfish public
service would be instilled in the students. The nucleus of a
trained military corps would be established from which officers
and men could be recruited with but little additional training
in time of war.&mdash;<cite>Puck</cite>.<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11"></a><a title="Go to footnote 11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> </p></blockquote>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Chapter&nbsp;<abbr title="16">XVI</abbr> constructive editorials were discussed. The object of
this chapter is to present a few exercises on destructive editorials.
Their object, of course, is not really to create ruin; it is merely to
clear away rubbish in order to prepare the ground for the edifice of
truth.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment</h3>

<p>Write an editorial in reply to an editorial in which a false position is
assumed by the writer.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Model&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr></h3>

<blockquote><p>Vice-President Marshall&#8217;s declaration, made some time ago at
Wabash College, that the old man is being shoved off the stage
everywhere, needs revision, as does the opinion of another
statesman that men over fifty are atrophied.</p>

<p>In the last great war between France and Germany the campaign
was planned and led by elderly men. The Emperor William, then
King of Prussia, was in his seventy-fourth year; Von Moltke, the
master strategist of the war, was seventy-one years old; General
von Roon was sixty-eight; and Bismarck, the master mind in the
larger field, was in his fifty-sixth year.</p>

<p>In the next great war in which high military efficiency<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;103">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a> was
displayed, Admiral Togo was approaching his sixtieth year when
he took the field; Prince Oyama, the commander-in-chief of the
Japanese forces in Manchuria, had passed his sixtieth year;
Field Marshal Nodzu was sixty-three; Field Marshal Yamagata was
sixty-six; General Kuroki was sixty; and General Nogi, who took
Port Arthur after a series of desperate conflicts, carried on
with unflinching energy and almost breathless rapidity, was
nearly sixty years of age.</p>

<p>In the present war Lord Kitchener, the organizing genius of the
English army, is sixty-four; and Sir John French, commanding the
English forces in the field, is sixty-two. When Lord Roberts was
sent to South Africa to snatch victory out of defeat, he was
sixty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>On the French side, General Joffre is sixty-two; General Pau is
sixty-six; General Castelnau, the third in command, is well
advanced in the sixties; and General Gallieni, who is in command
of the defenses of Paris, is seventy.</p>

<p>The German armies are also led by a group of elderly men. Count
von Huelsenberg has reached the mature age of seventy-eight;
Field Marshal von der Goltz is seventy-one; General von Kluck
has reached his sixty-eighth year; General von Emmich was
sixty-six; and General von Hindenberg is sixty-seven.</p>

<p>These figures suggest that, while fifty may be the deadline
among Democratic statesmen, it appears to be a kind of life-line
among great leaders abroad.&mdash;Adapted from <cite>The Outlook</cite>,
November&nbsp;<abbr title="the eleventh">11</abbr>, 1914.<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13"></a><a title="Go to footnote 13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> </p></blockquote>



<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Analysis</h3>

<p>Observe the framework. Paragraph&nbsp;1 states the point to be proved.
Paragraphs <abbr title="2 to 5">2&ndash;5</abbr> are composed of examples, arranged thus:</p>

<ol class="middle">
<li>The War of 1871.</li>
<li>The War of 1905.</li>
<li>The Present War.
<ol class="alph">
<li><span class="normal">France.</span></li>
<li><span class="normal">England.</span></li>
<li><span class="normal">Germany.</span></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;104">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>The order, in other words, is at once the order of chronology and that
of climax, which combine to make the facts easy to remember. Paragraph&nbsp;6
summarizes the argument and clinches it by a sharp antithesis.</p>


<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Exercises</h3>

<ol>
<li>Using a similar framework, write an editorial disproving by
examples the point made by the writer of the model.</li>

<li>Write an editorial proving by examples any proposition which
you believe to be true and in which you are deeply
interested.</li>

<li>Prove or disprove by example any one of the following
propositions:
<ol class="alph">
<li><span class="normal">Left-hand batters are better than right-hand batters.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Germans are better ball-players than Irishmen.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Frenchmen cannot play ball.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Men write better than women.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Asphalt pavements are more durable than brick pavements.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Germany has contributed more to the world&#8217;s culture than
England.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">College graduates are more successful as statesmen than
are self-made men.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Very tall men have ever very empty heads.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Athletes usually succeed well in after life.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">Dr. Samuel Johnson was a great wit. (For Johnson,
substitute, if you wish, Geoffrey Chaucer, William
Shakespeare, Francis Bacon, Samuel Butler, Alexander Pope,
Charles Lamb, Sidney Smith, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James
Russell Lowell, or Mark Twain.)</span></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>In the model there are twenty-two examples. In your composition there
must be at least ten.</p>

<h4>WHAT DOES A MAN PRODUCE?</h4>

<p>Among the banners of the unemployed in New York when they came
in collision with the police was one reading, &ldquo;We Want All We
Produce.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;105">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>There is a common impression among Socialistic workmen,
encouraged by some of the new-fangled college professors, that
the weaver produces all the cloth that comes off the loom he
tends, and he is robbed if his wages are only a part of the
value of the cloth. But he is only one of a long line of
producers, each of whom has to get some of the money for which
that cloth is sold.</p>

<p>There was a farmer who grew the raw fiber. There was a railroad
that transported the fiber. There was a long list of workmen who
did various things in the preparation of that fiber. It took
several classes of men to convert that fiber into yarn. Some men
dug the coal and a railroad hauled it. It took a good many men a
considerable time to build the loom and the engine and the mill,
and all of them have got to be paid. The men who have paid all
these previous classes of workers may reimburse themselves out
of a part of the proceeds of the bolt of cloth without
committing any robbery. What are the dividends but the
reimbursement of the people that have paid the miners and
mechanics and builders for their work before the cloth was sold?</p>

<p>The report of the Comptroller of the Currency shows that the
average return on all the shares and bonds of all the
corporations in the United States is 4.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. That doesn&#8217;t
look unreasonable. It isn&#8217;t very much more than savings-bank
interest. Of course, some corporations make very much more, but
many must make nothing in order to bring the average down to
4.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Besides, there are a few bonds that do not pay
4.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent or more, so that the average return on the shares,
which represent the ownership of the mills and factories, would
be less than 4.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.</p>

<p>What does a man produce? Well, put a man with only his bare
hands upon a spot of earth, or in a mine hole, or by the side of
a stream and how much will he produce? What are the chances that
he will not starve to death before he can produce anything? If
you give him tools, and &ldquo;grub-stake&rdquo; him, in mining lingo, or
support him until he has produced something and it has been
marketed, the produce of other men has been given him. They have
got to be paid for their produce in some way. The man in
question can&#8217;t have all he produces without defrauding the men
who produced<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;106">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a> the tools and food which he used during the time
he was getting his product made or extracted.<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14"></a><a title="Go to footnote 14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia

<h3><abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>&nbsp;Analysis</h3>

<ol>
<li>What is proved by this editorial?</li>

<li>The method of Model&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr> consists of overwhelming the enemy
with an avalanche of examples. The method of Model&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> is to
define the words used by an opponent and, by analyzing the
meaning of what he asserts, to prove that he does not see
his way through the question.</li>

<li>Note the framework: (<abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;1) &ldquo;Four W&#8217;s&rdquo;; (<abbr title="Paragraph">Par.</abbr>&nbsp;2) Statement

&ldquo;Interest.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Write an answer to the model.</li>

<li>Write an editorial refuting some current fallacy or what you
deem such. Use the analytic method of the model.</li>

<li>Examine the editorials in some current paper to determine
whether they are expository or argumentative, constructive
or destructive, if their frameworks are as good as those of
the models, if their matter is as convincing, if their style
is as good, and if their total effect is better or worse.</li>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> no field is the writer of English more generously rewarded than in
advertising. The annual expenditure for advertising in the United States
is close to $1,000,000,000 and is rapidly increasing. Writers skilled in
presenting goods to the public command very large salaries in the
distribution of this great sum. The profession has been steadily
attaining higher standards and has made a place for its members in
nearly every business house in the country. It is certain, however, that
there is still a vast field open for advertising development.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr></h3>

<p>Make a list of the reasons that would induce you to buy a particular
kind of fountain pen; suit of clothes; set of books; stove or range;
lead pencil; candy.</p>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Example</h3>

<p>(See <a href="#Page_109">page&nbsp;109</a>.)</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Definition</h3>

<p>An advertisement is an argumentative composition cut down to its
simplest elements, a composition in which single words represent
sentences or even paragraphs of ordinary writing. A sentence in an
advertisement frequently conveys the meaning that in ordinary writing
would be expanded into a long descriptive essay. The principles of
composition-writing apply to advertising in the superlative degree.
Above all things else, an advertisement must be clear, coherent, and
forceful. In addition to these things it must be brief.</p>

<p>From the reasons that you have listed in Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr>, pick out the one
that most attracts you in the case of each of the articles named. Give a
reason for your choice. Find a quality in each article that you
especially desire but rarely find.</p>


<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Forcefulness in Advertising</h3>

<p>An advertisement must first of all demand and win attention. The first
word, the first sentence, must be strong enough to arrest the eye of the
average reader, who runs hastily through the advertising matter of a
magazine, newspaper, or other medium. It must catch the reader&#8217;s
interest, and hold his attention long enough to lead him into the
remainder of the argument.</p>

<p>So far as possible the first sentence, in some cases the first word,
should contain the heart of the message, the one big thing that you have
to say about the article you have to advertise. If you fail to get your
reader&#8217;s interest with your first sentence, the word or words that
attracted his attention to your advertisement, you have lost him
forever. You will have no opportunity to present to him the argument
that may follow. Your attention words are read by your<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;111">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a> maximum
audience. Your most attractive argument in its most striking form should
therefore be presented to them at once.</p>


<h3><abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr></h3>

<p>Write a sentence presenting the arguments selected in Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> in
the strongest and most attractive sentences that you can devise. Reduce
the sentences to the single words that express the ideas most vividly.</p>


<h3><abbr title="8">VIII.</abbr>&nbsp;Humor in Advertising</h3>

<p>As an attention feature, a touch of humor is valuable in advertising. It
tends to put the reader into a pleasant frame of mind, a frame of mind
in which he is likely to listen more attentively to what you have to
say. It operates in the same way as the funny story that usually
prefaces the remarks of the after-dinner speaker. The humor, however,
must have a direct and unmistakable bearing on the body of your
advertising. Irrelevant humor is as much a waste of valuable advertising
space as an irrelevant illustration. Advertising space costs too much to
be used for anything but advertising. Grotesque illustrations and
far-fetched puns are no longer found in advertising columns, because
they have been found ineffective.</p>


<h3><abbr title="9">IX.</abbr>&nbsp;Illustrations</h3>

<p>In advertising practice the attention feature is frequently supplied by
an illustration showing the article advertised in the use that is
emphasized in the body of the advertisement, or in a way to illustrate
the special argument presented. The importance of the attention factor
is indicated by the large amount of<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;112">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a> space that is occupied by such
illustrations. Some experiments have indicated, however, that a
well-written attention line is fully as effective as an average
illustration.</p>

<span class="i0">And all your vows move not the gods above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the knife strikes me there will be one prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The less to them; and purer can there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any, or more fervent, than the daughter&#8217;s prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her dear father&#8217;s safety and success?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A groan that shook him shook not his resolve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged man now entered, and without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One word stepped slowly on, and took the wrist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the pale maiden. She looked up, and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fillet of the priest and calm, cold eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turned she where her parent stood, and cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O father! grieve no more; the ships can sail.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Discretion of speech is more than eloquence; and to speak
agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good
words or in good order.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite class="smcap">Francis Bacon.</cite> </p></blockquote>


<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Clip</span> from current newspapers or magazines five advertisements which in
your opinion have effective attention lines. Pick out five
advertisements which in your opinion have ineffective attention lines.
Give your reasons for your choice.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr></h3>

<ol class="alph">
<li><span class="normal">Taking the attention arguments selected in the preceding
chapter, set down all the questions that you might ask as
a possible customer if you had been attracted by the
attention line.</span></li>

<li><span class="normal">In the five examples of effective advertising selected
from newspapers or magazines, set down the questions that
are answered in the matter following the attention lines.</span></li>
</ol>


<h3><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Coherence in Advertising</h3>

<p>An effective advertisement must be a logically developed argument
leading from the attraction of attention to the point where the reader
is convinced that he wants your goods, and beyond that to the point
where he will take some definite physical action to get them.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;115">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>The steps intervening between attention and action may be sketched in
the briefest terms, may in some exceptional cases be omitted entirely
from the final form of the advertisement, but must be carefully worked
out in the mind of the writer, no step being omitted that is essential
in the chain of reasoning that the ordinary mind must follow.</p>

<p>Obviously the chain of reasoning must start from the attention line. If
you have attracted your reader by saying &ldquo;Prices Cut,&rdquo; you must tell him
how much the reduction is and why you have made the reduction. If, on
the other hand, you have attracted the attention by saying &ldquo;Our Goods
are the Best,&rdquo; you must explain the reasons why they are the best. That
the mind of the reader may be held to the line of the argument from
attention to action, all material that has no bearing upon this line of
argument must be excluded.</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Exercise</h3>

<p>Answer the questions about the various articles set down in
Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr>, being careful to follow the logical order in which they
would occur and to exclude all material that does not relate directly to
the argument you have selected.</p>


<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Clinching Results</h3>

<p>When you have attracted the attention of your reader and carried him
along through a logical argument to the conviction that he wants your
goods, one thing more remains. He must be induced to act upon his
conviction. Up to this point his part has been passive; he has been
asked merely to sit in his easy chair and read what you have to say. Now
he must be<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;116">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a> aroused to activity; he must be brought to the point of
putting on his hat and coat and going out to buy your goods. The
strongest language form at our command is required here, the direct
urgent imperative. Involuntarily people tend to obey orders that are
given them. The appeal must, of course, be courteous, so as not to
offend; but it must be strong enough to induce action. Compare the
strength of &ldquo;Sign here for free booklet&rdquo; with &ldquo;If you will sign on this
line, we will send you our free booklet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When your reader has been aroused to action, his way should be made as
easy as possible. Every direction that he may need should be plainly
before him, every convenience that will reduce his action to a minimum.
He should be told clearly how and where he can get the goods that you
have convinced him he wants, your name, your address, your telephone
number, and everything else that will enable him to reach you promptly
and certainly.</p>


<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr></h3>

<p>Write a compelling sentence for each of the advertisements constructed
in Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr> (<i>a</i>), adding the necessary conclusion.</p>

attractive feature of one of the articles selected in the preceding

attention to action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quotsig">Benjamin Franklin.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><abbr title="1">I.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pick</span> out in a large advertisement for a breakfast food the number of
words of one syllable other than prepositions or articles; the words of
two syllables; of three syllables; of more than three syllables. Reduce
your results to percentages.</p>

<p>Make a similar study of advertisements for a set of books, of chewing
gum, of an automobile, and of a piece of machinery in some technical
publication. Compare results with a similar count in a newspaper
paragraph, an encyclopedia paragraph, and paragraphs from Macaulay,
Dickens, Carlyle, and Kipling.</p>


<h3><abbr title="2">II.</abbr>&nbsp;Clearness</h3>

<p>Clear, simple language, language that will be readily understood by the
least intelligent of your possible customers, is an essential of good
advertising. Every word that is above the lowest reasonable level of
understanding limits the number of possible customers. The railroad
attorney who was asked to write a notice that would warn people to be
careful at railroad crossings did not dig into his law books for a
polysyllabic sentence like this: &ldquo;Whereas this is the intersection of a
public highway with the right-of-way of the &mdash;&mdash; Railroad Corporation,
each and every individual is hereby advised to exercise extreme
caution.&rdquo; He wrote a sentence which is a classic in its way &ldquo;Stop! Look!
Listen! Railroad Crossing.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;119">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><abbr title="3">III.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="2">II</abbr></h3>

<p>In the advertisements selected for Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr>, count the number of
words in each sentence and strike an average for each. Make a comparison
with sentence length in other writings as suggested.</p>


<h3><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr>&nbsp;Adaptation to Audience</h3>

<p>The degree to which the simplification of language in an advertisement
should be carried depends upon the audience addressed. It is evident
that a larger and less educated portion of the public is included in the
possible customers for breakfast food and chewing gum than there are in
the portion who would be likely to purchase a set of books. An even
smaller portion of the public would be interested in an automobile or a
piece of automatic machinery. A good advertisement should be framed in
language that will be understood by all possible purchasers of an
article. Many household articles, such as bread, breakfast food, candy,
and confections, are advertised in language that a fourth-grade child
will readily understand.</p>


<h3><abbr title="5">V.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="3">III</abbr></h3>

<p>Write an advertisement for an athletic contest in which your school will
take part, addressing it to the students in your school.</p>

<p>Write an advertisement to introduce a new candy or confection among
grammar-school children.</p>

<p>Write an advertisement for boys&#8217; hats; for girls&#8217; hats; for overalls;
for a magazine devoted to automobiles; for a magazine devoted to
fiction.</p>


<h3><abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>&nbsp;Simplicity in Structure</h3>

<p>An advertisement must be clear, not only in language and construction,
but in mechanical structure<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;120">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a> as well. Attention-lines and command-lines
must be short and set up so as to stand out clearly from the body of the
advertisement. The eye takes in automatically from four to six words at
a glance, setting the natural limit of length for strong features in an
advertisement. Artistic arrangement helps an advertisement because
carefully balanced matter is more attractive than inartistic
combinations. A well-balanced advertisement, an advertisement in which
the points are properly subordinated, conveys its meaning to the reader
more easily than a badly distributed statement of the same arguments. In
the last analysis good art is little more than good order, order that is
pleasing to the eye as well as the mind. Good order requires a
distribution of eye-effects that coincides with the distribution of mind
effects.</p>


<h3><abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="4">IV</abbr></h3>

<p>Measure ten particularly attractive advertisements, illustrated or
otherwise. Find the line on which the attention is focused and measure
its distance from the top and bottom. Test these distances by the
formul&aelig;:</p>

<div style="float:left; margin-right:4em; width:12em;">

<var>AC</var> = .62&nbsp;inch.<br />

</ol>

<p style="clear:both;"><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;121">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>This is the so-called &ldquo;golden rectangle,&rdquo; the most pleasing of all
rectangular forms. The attention-line <var>CD</var> is at the point that makes the
upper section a &ldquo;golden rectangle.&rdquo; The capital letter &ldquo;H&rdquo; is also one
of the most common arrangements in advertising. The square is another
pleasing figure and there are many other forms in which advertising
matter may be balanced.</p>


<h3><abbr title="8">VIII.</abbr>&nbsp;Brevity</h3>

<p>Advertising occupies space for which a high rate frequently is paid.
Brief statement is therefore a factor of great importance. If a small
space is all that is available, the problem of attracting attention
becomes most important. It should be evident that a few words clearly
and plainly printed are far more effective in a small space than a long
message that is in such fine print that it will strain the eyes of the
reader. In the one case you say something at least to your reader. In
the other, you have no chance to say anything because you have tried to
say too much. When it is necessary to confine your message to a small
space, the attention-sentence, or in some cases the command-sentence, is
the part to use. Many signs seen from the rapidly moving window of a
street-car or railroad train carry only the name of the product
attractively displayed, with a command to use it.</p>


<h3><abbr title="9">IX.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="5">V</abbr></h3>

<p>Select one of the articles for which you have written advertising and
write a complete advertising campaign for it, including five newspaper
advertisements, five magazine advertisements, a four-page folder for
distribution, signs for street-cars, signs for posting<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;122">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a> along highways,
and other devices that you think would be effective.</p>


<h3><abbr title="10">X.</abbr>&nbsp;Classified Advertisements</h3>

<p>Most newspapers carry columns of classified advertising consisting of
many small advertisements grouped together under various heads. These
are commonly used by the public for getting help; obtaining situations;
buying, selling, and renting real estate; and disposing of miscellaneous
articles. The principles of advertising compositions apply also to these
advertisements. The attention-factor is not so important, however, as
the reader of the advertisements in the classified columns is looking
for the article or service that you to have sell. A glance through the
classified columns of a newspaper will show clearly the increased
attractiveness resulting from the skillful arrangement of details and
the use of clear forceful words.</p>


<h3><abbr title="11">XI.</abbr>&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;<abbr title="6">VI</abbr></h3>

<p>Write an advertisement offering a room of your home to rent, using not
more than thirty words; an advertisement applying for work for which you
consider yourself fitted; an advertisement offering for sale a house
with which you are familiar.</p>

discover them.</li>
<li>Chapters <abbr title="5">V</abbr>, <abbr title="6">VI</abbr>, and <abbr title="12">XII</abbr> of Book&nbsp;<abbr title="1">I</abbr> should be reviewed at
frequent intervals until their contents become as familiar

and persistency. Before it is reached, the average pupil
will have learned and forgotten over and over again the
material involved. These chapters may sometimes be reviewed
as wholes, but it is also well to take a small section of
each daily.</li>
